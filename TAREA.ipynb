      "\n",
      "He was no stranger to problems. He had been living with them for the\n",
      "past few years, and they had been problems the like of which had never\n",
      "before challenged the ingenuity of man. For he was the head of a small\n",
      "community of men, scientists like himself--medical specialists of all\n",
      "kinds, psychologists, electronic technicians, physicists, pressure\n",
      "engineers, mathematicians and so on, each one of them an acknowledged\n",
      "expert in his particular field--who had worked together with one end\n",
      "in view: to send a man into space and bring him back safely to Earth\n",
      "again. To put it more excitingly: to enable man to take his first step\n",
      "toward the conquest of the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result of their labors to date was the Capsule, a bottle-shaped\n",
      "contraption which occupied the center of the laboratory floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't very big; just big enough to contain a man enclosed in a\n",
      "spacesuit, lying on a couch surrounded by instruments. But there wasn't\n",
      "a square inch of the capsule itself, the spacesuit, and the instruments\n",
      "which hadn't presented innumerable problems, the solving of which had\n",
      "been the result of endless research and theorizing and testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the same way, and almost to the same extent, there wasn't a\n",

      "which must be solved before he could be sent into space.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, in test after test, one of the chosen astronauts had lain on\n",
      "the couch in the capsule, wired through his spacesuit to the dozens of\n",
      "dials and graph recorders on the consoles at which sat the watching\n",
      "specialists. It seemed there was nothing that could happen inside his\n",
      "body that they could not know about. They could read every flexing\n",
      "of his muscles, every heartbeat, every tiny shifting of temperature,\n",
      "every reaction of his blood and of his complicated nervous system. On\n",
      "the encephalograph, they could even detect reactions in the mass of\n",
      "gray matter which was his brain, any sign of tension there, and above\n",
      "all, any symptom of that strange phenomenon of which so little was yet\n",
      "known, and which was called the \"breakoff\"--the eerie sensation of\n",
      "complete isolation from Earth, the trancelike apathy and indifference\n",
      "to survival that can attack not only high-flying pilots, but deep-sea\n",
      "divers, \"the rapture of the depths,\" and sometimes it was accompanied\n",
      "by hallucinations in which strange forms and sounds were seen and heard.\n",

      "In the case of Lieutenant Hamilton Richardson, USN, there had been\n",
      "no mysterious troubles of this kind--in fact, no troubles of any\n",
      "kind at all. Aged thirty-six, he had been one of the first of the\n",
      "astronauts to volunteer. He had passed with flying colors every one\n",
      "of the grueling preliminary tests, mental and physical, and as far as\n",
      "could be judged by science, he had seemed to be the perfect specimen,\n",
      "mentally and physically, for the job. In the many tests made with him\n",
      "inside the capsule, nothing had gone wrong with him. There had been\n",
      "no signs of fatigue or failure of any kind. Had Snow been asked who,\n",
      "in his opinion, would be the first man--or, at any rate, the first\n",
      "American--to go into deep space, he would unhesitatingly have nominated\n",
      "Richardson. That is to say, until that afternoon when the thing had\n",
      "happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been a long test, one made for the first time. The object of\n",
      "it was to find out how the spacesuit, which was sealed off from the\n",
      "rest of the capsule, would stand up if something happened to the\n",
      "capsule itself. If, for instance, in its headlong flight through space,\n",
      "something struck it, something, maybe, no bigger than a small pebble.\n",
      "The odds were that in collision with even so small a meteor, the shell\n",
      "of the capsule would be punctured, and within a minute or less, the\n",
      "atmospheric pressure inside it, fixed at about five thousand feet above\n",
      "sea level, would be reduced to zero. In other words, the capsule would\n",
      "become a vacuum in which nothing on Earth could live. The astronaut\n",
      "would then have to depend upon his spacesuit which, being pressurized,\n",
      "and being really a capsule within a capsule, with its own supply of\n",
      "oxygen, would be the one hope of survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "That day, the test had consisted of the \"puncturing\" of the capsule.\n",
      "At a given signal, the pressure inside it had been reduced to that of\n",
      "fifty miles above the Earth's surface--in other words, to zero--by\n",
      "pumping out the air inside it. Richardson, the ace of the astronauts,\n",
      "had been chosen for this important test.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had gone well. With the other scientists at their dials, Snow,\n",
      "seated at the big console of literally dozens of dials, the only one to\n",
      "be connected with Richardson by sound and speech, had given the signal.\n",
      "In a minute, the capsule had become a vacuum fifty miles above the\n",
      "surface of the Earth, outside its envelope of atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Richardson's voice, reading his instruments, acknowledging Snow's\n",
      "instructions, answering his questions, had come through as normal\n",
      "and as calm as ever. Snow had felt a rising excitement as the test\n",
      "proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, without warning, the thing had happened. Richardson's voice\n",
      "had stopped in the middle of an instrument reading, as if it had\n",
      "suddenly been cut off. A few seconds later, it had resumed. But when\n",
      "it did so, the voice was uttering a stream of unintelligible sounds\n",
      "in a low, lilting chant. Snow had listened incredulously for perhaps\n",
      "thirty seconds, at the end of which the sounds had suddenly ceased.\n",
      "Immediately, Snow had given instructions for the normal pressure inside\n",
      "the capsule to be restored. Almost as he had done so, Richardson's\n",
      "voice, once again normal, had resumed the reading of the instruments,\n",
      "taking up from where it had left off a minute before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acting on a sudden impulse. Snow had decided to say nothing over the\n",
      "wire to Richardson at the time. He had continued his conversation with\n",
      "the astronaut, telling him they were \"bringing him down\" and asking the\n",
      "usual questions until the test ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "When, with the others, he had stood around watching while Richardson\n",
      "was helped out of his spacesuit, he had carefully watched their faces,\n",
      "looking for some sign of doubt or puzzlement. But he saw none. On the\n",
      "contrary, they all seemed triumphantly satisfied. Even Richardson had\n",
      "shown no sign that anything unusual had occurred. He had been his usual\n",
      "cheerful self, seeming not even slightly fatigued by the long test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being the only one who had been in contact with Richardson, Snow\n",
      "had suddenly found himself wondering if he really had heard those\n",
      "sounds, if, maybe, he had been the victim of a hallucination. This\n",
      "was why he had said nothing about it at the time. He had just asked,\n",
      "as casually as he could, if any of them had anything they wanted to\n",
      "bring up immediately. They had shaken their heads, beaming their\n",
      "satisfaction, and he had dismissed them all, saying that in view of the\n",
      "length of the test they might all call it a day, and postponing the\n",
      "usual interrogation until the morrow. Then he had hurried back to his\n",
      "quarters, bringing with him the recording machine on which, as was the\n",
      "practice, his conversation with Richardson during the test had been\n",
      "recorded. Controlling his impatience with difficulty, he had rewound\n",
      "the tape on the machine and played it back, the tension rising within\n",
      "him as he listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been no hallucination. He heard Richardson's voice reading\n",
      "the instrument, the sudden cut-off in the middle of it, the short\n",
      "silence, then the voice uttering the strange sounds in a low-pitched\n",
      "chant with a gentle rise and fall to it. Three times he had played it\n",
      "back, and now it seemed to him that these were not just disconnected\n",
      "sounds. They appeared to have a cadence, a phrasing which indicated\n",
      "that they belonged to a language of some sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snow was no linguist. He had less than a fair conversational knowledge\n",
      "of French and German, and a scholar's acquaintance with Latin, but he\n",
      "had travelled very extensively in his time and had been accustomed\n",
      "to hear many languages spoken. He was quite sure he had never heard\n",
      "anything even remotely resembling these sounds. Certainly Richardson\n",
      "was no linguist either. He was third-generation American from British\n",
      "stock, and all he knew about languages was what he had learned in\n",
      "school.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Then where had those sounds come from? Were they a language, and if\n",
      "so, what did they mean? How could this happen to a man like Richardson\n",
      "without his knowing about it? Did it mean that here was, after all,\n",
      "something strange about him which the man himself might not even know\n",
      "about, and which might mean that he was not fit for the project? This\n",
      "last question worried Snow more than the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to the telephone on his desk and dialed the Richardson\n",
      "bungalow. The voice of Richardson's pretty wife answered him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes? Sandra Richardson here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, Sandra. Phil Snow calling. Is Ham there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's in the shower singing his head off. Shall I get him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it isn't important. I just wanted to ask him again if he feels all\n",
      "right after the test. It was rather a long one, and I wondered if he\n",
      "might feel tired, or....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tired? He seems even more full of pep than usual. Was the test so very\n",
      "long, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it was. That's why I called and--just to tell him it was a\n",
      "success. I haven't checked all the reports yet, but it looks good. And\n",
      "you say he's as usual?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Why? There wasn't anything...?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, nothing at all. Just as I said. I'll be seeing you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He rang off, hoping that nothing he had said was now making Sandra\n",
      "Richardson suspicious, and resumed his pacing up and down the floor.\n",
      "Now another question came into his mind. The same test would be run\n",
      "several times again before final conclusions could be made. Should\n",
      "he wait for them to see if this thing happened again before starting\n",
      "anything with Richardson and his colleagues? But even as he asked\n",
      "himself the question, he knew the answer. If this never again happened\n",
      "in any future test, the fact would remain that it had happened once\n",
      "and could not be forgotten or brushed aside. It must be cleared up.\n",
      "Something had happened to Richardson's mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He decided to take Abe Franstein, his head psychologist, into his\n",
      "confidence. As he dialed Franstein's bungalow, he recalled with a sense\n",
      "of comfort that the brilliant little man was not only a world authority\n",
      "in his particular subject, but that he was said to be able to read,\n",
      "write, and converse in a staggering number of languages, some of them\n",
      "obscure Oriental dialects.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Franstein answered the call, Snow asked him to drop in for coffee\n",
      "after dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "                                  II\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I must say,\" said Franstein as they sipped their coffee, \"yours\n",
      "is the first glum face I've seen around here since that test this\n",
      "afternoon. Here we are, within sight of our goal at last, and look at\n",
      "you! Weren't you satisfied?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before I go into that,\" Snow replied, \"there are a few things I want\n",
      "to ask you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About the test?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In a way, but principally about Richardson. Have you ever had any\n",
      "reason to suspect that there is anything unusual about him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In what way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In your line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Franstein produced an enormous meerschaum pipe and proceeded to fill it\n",
      "from an untidy plastic pouch as he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, there is. One very unusual thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's got a very rare type of mind. It's probably perfectly balanced.\"\n",
      "The little man lit his pipe and continued: \"The vast majority of us\n",
      "have some sort of imbalance, mentally. He hasn't. When I say imbalance,\n",
      "I mean the sort of thing that makes for genius, a phenomenal memory, an\n",
      "outstanding, effortless talent, amnesia, any form of insanity, or even\n",
      "something like a violent temper. Anything, so to speak, overemphasized.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it physical? I mean, does it have anything to do with the size or\n",
      "weight of the brain, or anything like that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can take the brain of a genius and that of an ordinary person of\n",
      "average intelligence, and find them exactly the same in measurements\n",
      "and tissue condition. The popular conception of the genius as a man\n",
      "with a bulging forehead is so much nonsense. Plenty of lunatics and\n",
      "retarded individuals have bulging foreheads.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then what does it have to do with?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! That's the big question. Nobody knows. You can take two men, equal\n",
      "physically in every respect, equal in upbringing, education, health,\n",
      "and with the same sized brain. One of them might turn out to be a\n",
      "genius, the other an average individual, and nobody knows what makes\n",
      "the difference. Nobody knows what makes an infant prodigy, or what it\n",
      "is which enables a child of two to read easily, or a kid of five or\n",
      "six to play some instrument as if he'd been at it for years or compose\n",
      "symphonies, or master advanced mathematics. Same answer. Nobody knows.\n",
      "It's got nothing to do with heredity. So few geniuses have had genius\n",
      "offspring that they form exceptions to the rule. Again, why does an\n",
      "infant prodigy sometimes lose his gift or talent entirely as he grows\n",
      "older? We don't know. All we know is that the gift or talent is there,\n",
      "but where it comes from, or why it is in one brain and not in another,\n",
      "we don't know. But surely you don't have to have me to tell you all\n",
      "this, Phil? What's on your mind?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Listen to this,\" Snow said, and went to the tape recorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",

      "_Play_, and presently they heard the two voices, Snow's and\n",
      "Richardson's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now!\" said Snow as the point on the tape approached.\n",
      "\n",
      "There came the sudden stopping of Richardson's voice in the middle\n",
      "of an instrument reading, the short silence, then Richardson's voice\n",
      "chanting the strange sounds. Franstein took his pipe from between his\n",
      "teeth and his mouth fell open as he listened. The sounds ceased and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That's all,\" said Snow, and switched off the machine.\n",

      "said: \"Well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Franstein went to the table and helped himself to more coffee before\n",
      "replying. \"It's a new one on me,\" he said presently. \"I've got about a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No. I rang his bungalow just before dinner and spoke to Sandra.\n",

      "spoke learnedly and with great respect. He talked of reincarnation,\n",
      "spiritualism, the mystery of time, and in this last connection, he\n",

      "a lot of things. You can split the atom, measure the stars, estimate\n",

      "know everything. And you will too, except for one thing--the one final\n",
      "mystery, the last secret of the universe--MAN. And that means you and\n",
      "me, and any human being from a bum of Skid Row to the President. Man\n",
      "is the eternal unknown quantity, and you've never had a more clear\n",
      "demonstration of this than what happened to Richardson this afternoon.\n",
      "Oh, I know what you've found out. You know all about man, his insides,\n",
      "his glands, muscles, nerves, brain, and so on. You can even display him\n",
      "on a table as a bucket of water and little piles of salts and minerals,\n",
      "and you can point to them and say: 'That is what man is made of.' Only\n",
      "the other day I was reading about some scientist who thinks he's on\n",
      "the verge of producing a cell of life in a test tube. You may even do\n",
      "that, and you may find out one day how to put the water and the salts\n",

      "Snow. \"I think I know the way out of this. Play the recording for Ham\n",
      "to hear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Snow hesitated for a moment. \"All right, if you think so,\" he said, and\n",
      "busied himself with the recorder, replacing the used tape on the spool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sandra perched herself on the arm of her husband's chair and put an arm\n",
      "about his shoulders. They waited while Snow linked up the end of the\n",
      "tape to the other spool. He pressed the _Play_ switch, and presently\n",
      "there came the voices of Snow and Richardson.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's this afternoon's test,\" Richardson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Franstein nodded, and they continued to listen. Then came the chanting\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But this is crazy. How could I make a noise like that without knowing\n",
      "anything about it? Why, I remember every second of that test, and I\n",
      "know I didn't do anything like that.\" He jumped to his feet and began\n",
      "to walk up and down the room, his hands pressed to his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I said take it easy, Ham,\" Franstein said.\n",

      "even tired, and now you tell me that in the middle of it I had some\n",
      "sort of a blackout and made funny noises. That can only mean that\n",
      "there's something wrong with me, and you don't have to tell me what\n",
      "that means. I don't qualify, after all. Is that what you came here to\n",

      "the sort. If there'd been a blackout or if something else had happened\n",
      "to your brain, it would have shown up on the encephalograph, and\n",
      "nothing showed. I didn't know about this until I heard the recording,\n",
      "and we weren't going to say anything about it until we'd run the test\n",
      "a second time. Then Sandra called us to say she couldn't wake you and\n",
      "that you were talking in your sleep, and we came over to find you in a\n",
      "sleep as deep as a coma and obviously dreaming.\"\n",

      "in his sleep, and when he's awake too, without knowing it.\" He went to\n",
      "the deep chair and slumped down into it. \"What do we do now? Go into\n",

      "added: \"Or do I resign from the project?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Where? I don't know. On Earth, I suppose. Open place, you know,\n",
      "only....\" He paused before going on. \"Only it wasn't standing up on end\n",
      "like a rocket. It was lying on its side, and we were loading it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who were 'we'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father and my two brothers. And that shows how silly the dream was\n",
      "because I haven't got any brothers or father. My father in the dream\n",
      "wasn't anything like my own. He was just an old man, and he told us\n",
      "where to stow the crates.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was in the crates?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the crates?\" Richardson looked up. \"Let me see now. Oh, yes, they\n",
      "were full of the seeds of plants and eggs and sperm of animals--sort of\n",
      "the beginnings of things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And where was the ship going to?\"\n",

      "Again, Richardson concentrated before replying. \"To another Earth,\" he\n",
      "said. \"That's right. The old guy, our father, said that this one was\n",

      "Richardson looked at him and suddenly a smile formed on his face. \"Now\n",
      "I know where that dream came from,\" he said. \"Remember that book _On\n",
      "The Beach_? The story about how everyone on Earth was wiped out by\n",
      "nuclear fallout? That's it! I remember wondering when I read it if some\n",
      "of us would be able to go to another planet before anything like that\n",
      "happened here, and I remember thinking, too, that we'd probably take\n",
      "things like seeds and so on with us, and even the ova of animals, and\n",
      "that by then we'd probably know how to preserve them--freeze them or\n",
      "something of the sort.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can do that now,\" Snow said.\n",
      "\n",

      "explanation.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "sounds? Particularly those you made in the capsule?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord, yes!\" said Richardson, and the smile left his face. \"I'd\n",

      "it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not so sure,\" said Franstein. He got to his feet and, in his turn,\n",

      "him to go on, and presently he turned to them, a glint of excitement in\n",
      "his eyes. \"I think we're onto something,\" he said. \"Those sounds are\n",
      "obviously a part of your dream, Ham, including the ones you made in the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I don't even remember making them!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but your mind does. If we can unlock your mind, we can find the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hypnosis?\" The others spoke at once.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know you are a hypnotist too, Abe,\" said Snow. \"I'm not\n",
      "surprised, though. I might have known.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Franstein took no notice of this. He stepped up to Richardson and\n",

      "earnestly. \"Complete confidence. You have that in me?\"\n",

      "must have an Imperial Army constructed to fit it. Let us see what we\n",
      "have got.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing that strikes us about the Army is that, although of\n",
      "a decent size, it is not by any means too largeâin fact, some people\n",
      "say that it is nothing like large enough. That, however, is a question\n",

      "\n",
      "The Empire contains, roughly, over 9,000,000 of square miles, and over\n",

      "\n",
      "altogether, 864,000 men at the outside. This apparently large number,\n",
      "however, includes every single able-bodied man, British or Native,\n",
      "who has been trained to bear arms: the Regular Army forms not quite\n",
      "a quarter of it. Taken altogether, this gives an average of about 1\n",
      "combatant to 350 non-combatantsânot a large proportion. Germanyâs\n",
      "proportion is 1 to 99. This is a large proportion, it is true, but\n",
      "then she is threatened by powerful enemies on her eastern and western\n",
      "frontiers, whereas we are an island, and look to our Navy as the first\n",
      "line of defence. This being so, we can do with a moderately small Army,\n",

      "countriesânamely, universal conscription.\n",

      "It is absolutely necessary, however, that we should follow the\n",
      "principle which underlies the military systems of all countries,\n",
      "whether their armies are composed of conscripts or not. This principle\n",
      "is that of keeping a small number of troops under arms in peace-time,\n",
      "with a large reserve of trained men ready to be called out in case\n",
      "of war. In our case, the small number under arms in peace-time is\n",

      "soldiering, and this is hardly a matter for congratulation. Up till\n",

      "During the Middle Ages the feudal system was in force, _i.e._, the\n",
      "retainers, tenants, and vassals of every knight were required to\n",
      "attend their master if he went to fight abroad. The knights in their\n",
      "turn were bound to attend the king when _he_ went to fight abroad,\n",
      "and thus a very respectable army was formed for the time being. This\n",
      "army, _i.e._, the knights and their followers, was called the Feudal\n",
      "Levy. Towards the end of the sixteenth century, members of the General\n",
      "Levy were told off for the service and defence of the Crown. They were\n",
      "trained and exercised in the profession of arms, and received the name\n",
      "of Trained Bands. The Honourable Artillery Company, a similar force,\n",
      "was raised about this time. The Sovereign could, if necessary, hire\n",
      "additional mercenary soldiers to assist him in war, and these were paid\n",
      "by Parliament. The Civil War, however, in Charles I.âs reign, upset the\n",

      "PREFACE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Until within the past few years, Mexico was a country not easily reached\n",
      "from the principal cities of the United States, and our relations with\n",
      "it were by no means intimate. Since the completion of the railway from\n",
      "the frontier of Texas to the heart of the most northerly of the\n",
      "Spanish-American republics, there has been a rapid development of\n",
      "commercial and social relations between Mexico and the United States,\n",
      "and the tide of travel from one country to the other is steadily\n",
      "increasing year by year. These circumstances have led the author of \"The\n",
      "Boy Travellers\" to believe that his young friends everywhere would\n",
      "welcome a book describing the land of the Aztecs, its history and\n",
      "resources, the manners and customs of its people, and the many curious\n",
      "things to be seen, and adventures passed through, in a journey from one\n",
      "end of that country to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this belief he sought the aid of his and their friends, Frank and\n",
      "Fred, immediately after their return from Australasia. Ever ready to be\n",
      "of service, the youths assented to his request to make a tour of the\n",
      "Mexican republic, in company with their guide and mentor, Doctor\n",
      "Bronson, and the result of their journey is set forth in the following\n",
      "pages. It is confidently hoped that the narrative will be found in every\n",
      "particular fully equal to any of its predecessors in the series to which\n",
      "it belongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The methods on which the Boy Travellers have hitherto performed their\n",
      "work have been adhered to in the present volume. In addition to his\n",
      "personal acquaintance with Mexico and travels in that country, the\n",
      "author has drawn upon the observations of those who have preceded and\n",
      "followed him there. He has consulted books of history, travel, and\n",
      "statistics in great number, has sought the best and most accurate maps,\n",
      "and while his work was in progress he consulted many persons familiar\n",
      "with Mexico, and was in frequent correspondence with gentlemen now\n",
      "residing there. He has sought to bring the social, political, and\n",
      "commercial history of the country down to the latest date, and to\n",
      "present a truthful picture of the present status of our sister\n",
      "republic. The result of his efforts he submits herewith to the judgment\n",
      "of his readers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the works that have been consulted are named in the text, but it\n",
      "has not been convenient to refer to all. Among those to which the author\n",
      "is indebted may be mentioned the following: Bishop's \"Old Mexico and her\n",
      "Lost Provinces,\" Griffin's \"Mexico of To-day,\" Haven's \"Our Next-door\n",
      "Neighbor,\" Charnay's \"Ancient Cities of the New World,\" Squier's\n",
      "\"Nicaragua\" and \"Central America,\" Wells's \"Honduras,\" Stephens's\n",
      "\"Travels in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan,\" Baldwin's \"Ancient\n",
      "America,\" Wilson's \"Mexico and its Religions,\" Abbott's \"Hernando\n",
      "Cortez,\" Prescott's \"Conquest of Mexico,\" Ober's \"Travels in Mexico,\"\n",
      "Geiger's \"Peep at Mexico,\" Gooch's \"Face to Face with the Mexicans,\"\n",
      "Chevalier's \"Mexique Ancien et Moderne,\" and the hand-books of Janvier,\n",
      "Conkling, and Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in the other \"Boy Traveller\" volumes, the author is indebted to the\n",
      "liberality of his publishers, Messrs. Harper & Brothers, for the use of\n",
      "engravings that have appeared in previous publications relative to\n",
      "Mexico and Central America, in addition to those specially prepared for\n",
      "this book. As a result of their generosity, he has been enabled to add\n",
      "greatly to the interest of the work, particularly to the younger portion\n",
      "of his readers, for whom illustrations always have an especial charm.\n",

      "\"Well, what is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're going to Mexico next week,\" answered Fred; \"at any rate, that is\n",

      "\n",
      "[Illustration: A NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The news is good news,\" was the reply; \"for Mexico is one of the\n",
      "countries that just now I want very much to see. We have heard a great\n",
      "deal about it since the railway was completed to the capital; and then,\n",
      "you know, the Mexicans are our neighbors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is true,\" said Fred; \"here we've been going all over the rest of\n",
      "the world, and haven't yet called on our neighbors, and next-door\n",
      "neighbors too. But we're not alone in this, as it is probable that for\n",
      "every inhabitant of the Northern States who has visited Mexico, a\n",
      "hundred have been across the Atlantic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This conversation occurred between Frank Bassett and Fred Bronson\n",
      "shortly after returning from their tour among the islands of the Pacific\n",
      "Ocean and through New Zealand, Tasmania, and Australia. The accounts of\n",
      "their journeys have appeared in several volumes, with which our readers\n",
      "are or should be familiar.[1]\n",

      "\n",
      "The youths waited with some impatience until evening, when they were to\n",
      "hear from Doctor Bronson the details of the proposed trip. In the mean\n",
      "time they devoted themselves to their Spanish grammars and dictionaries,\n",
      "which they had not seen for months, owing to their occupation with other\n",
      "matters. And we may here add that until their departure and while they\n",
      "were on the road, every moment that could be applied to the study of the\n",
      "language of the country whither they were bound was industriously\n",
      "employed. By the time they crossed the border they were able to speak\n",
      "Spanish very well, and had very little need of interpreters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall go to Mexico by rail,\" said the Doctor, \"and return by sea; at\n",
      "any rate, that is my plan at present, but circumstances may change it.\n",
      "It is my intention to visit the principal cities and other places of\n",
      "interest, and also to give some attention to the antiquities of the\n",
      "country and of Central America; exactly what places we shall see I\n",
      "cannot say at this moment, nor how long we shall be absent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall we need in the way of baggage?\" one of the youths asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About what you need for a long journey north and south in the United\n",
      "States,\" was the reply. \"You will need clothing for hot weather as well\n",
      "as for cold. We shall find it quite chilly in certain parts of the\n",
      "_tierra fria_, or highlands, and warm enough in the _tierra caliente_,\n",
      "or lowlands along the coast. You must have outer and under clothing\n",
      "adapted to warm and cool climates, and your ulsters may be placed for\n",
      "convenience in the same bundle with your linen dusters. Have a good\n",
      "supply of under-clothing, as the facilities for laundry-work are not the\n",
      "best, even in the large cities; but do not load yourselves with anything\n",
      "not absolutely necessary, as the Mexican railways allow only\n",
      "thirty-three pounds of baggage to a local passenger, and the charges for\n",
      "extra weight are high. Passengers with through tickets from the United\n",
      "States are entitled to one hundred and fifty pounds of baggage free.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" continued the Doctor, \"you will want some books on Mexico,\n",
      "partly for historical research and partly for description. There is an\n",
      "excellent guide-book which was written by Mr. Janvier, and there is\n",
      "another by Mr. Conkling; get them both, and also 'Old Mexico and her\n",
      "Lost Provinces,' by Mr. Bishop, 'Mexico of To-day,' by Mr. Griffin, and\n",
      "'Our Next-door Neighbor,' by Bishop Haven. Don't forget Charnay's\n",
      "'Ancient Cities of the New World,' and Prescott's 'Conquest of Mexico.'\n",
      "You can read the latter book before we go; it is inconveniently large\n",
      "for travelling purposes, and so we will leave it behind us, as we can\n",
      "easily find it in the City of Mexico, in case we wish to refer to it\n",
      "again. Abbott's 'Life of Hernando Cortez' is a more portable work, and\n",
      "will serve to refresh your memory concerning what you read in Prescott's\n",
      "volumes.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The conversation lasted an hour or more, and by the time it ended the\n",
      "boys almost felt that they were already in the land of the Aztecs. Their\n",
      "dreams through the night were of ancient temples and modern palaces,\n",
      "Aztec and Spanish warriors, snowy mountains and palm-covered plains,\n",
      "mines of silver and other metals, fortresses, cathedrals, haciendas and\n",
      "hovels, and of many races and tribes of men that dwell in the land they\n",
      "were about to see. Fred declared in the morning that he had dreamed of\n",
      "Montezuma and Maximilian walking arm in arm, and Frank professed to have\n",
      "had a similar vision concerning Cortez and General Scott.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next few days the youths had no spare time on their hands, and\n",
      "when the start was made for the proposed journey they were well prepared\n",
      "for it both mentally and materially. They had followed Doctor Bronson's\n",
      "directions as to their outfit of clothing and other things, had procured\n",
      "the books which he named, and, as we have already seen, had made a\n",
      "vigorous overhauling of their Spanish grammars and phrase-books.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: SCENE ON THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD.]\n",
      "\n",
      "From New York there are several routes westward, as our readers are\n",
      "pretty well aware, and the youths were a little puzzled to know which\n",
      "one would be chosen. The mystery was solved by the Doctor on the day\n",
      "before their departure. He announced that they would go to St. Louis by\n",
      "the Pennsylvania Railroad, and from there to the frontier of Mexico by\n",
      "the Missouri Pacific and Southern Pacific lines. \"And now,\" said he, \"I\n",
      "will leave you to choose the route to the capital city, and you need not\n",
      "decide until we reach St. Louis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor's suggestion compelled a study of the maps and a careful\n",
      "reading of the guide-books and other literature pertaining to the\n",
      "journey. The result of their study may be summed up as follows from an\n",
      "entry which Frank made in his note-book:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: STREET IN EL PASO.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first railway which was opened from the United States to the City\n",
      "of Mexico was the Mexican Central, which runs from El Paso, Texas, or\n",
      "rather from Paso del Norte, Mexico, which is opposite to El Paso, on the\n",
      "other side of the Rio Grande. Its length is 1224 miles, and it was\n",
      "completed March 8, 1884, at the station of Fresnillo, 750 miles from\n",
      "Paso del Norte, the line having been built from both ends at the same\n",
      "time. Three years and six months were required for its construction, and\n",
      "the line is said to have cost more than thirty-two millions of dollars;\n",
      "eight miles of track were laid during the last day of the work before\n",
      "the two ends of the line were brought together; and considering all the\n",
      "disadvantages of the enterprise, it reflects great credit upon those who\n",
      "managed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For more than four years the Mexican Central was the only all-rail\n",
      "route for travellers from the United States to the City of Mexico, and\n",
      "it had a practical monopoly of business. In 1888 two other lines were\n",
      "opened; or perhaps we might say, another line and half of a third. These\n",
      "are the Mexican National Railway, from Laredo, Texas, to Mexico City, a\n",
      "distance of 825 miles, and the International Railway, from Piedras\n",
      "Negras, Mexico, opposite Eagle Pass, Texas, to a point on the Mexican\n",
      "Central, about half-way between El Paso and Mexico. The International is\n",
      "the one which we call half a line, as it makes a new route into Mexico,\n",
      "and from all we can learn a very good one too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Central is a standard-gauge road, four feet eight and one-half\n",
      "inches wide, while the National is a narrow-gauge line, three feet\n",
      "between the rails; the advantage of the National line is that it is much\n",
      "shorter than the Central, as I will proceed to show.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From St. Louis to Mexico City, by way of Laredo, the distance is 1823\n",
      "miles, while by the Central line it is 2584 miles; there is thus a\n",
      "saving of 761 miles, or about thirty hours in time. But the Central will\n",
      "take us through five or six interesting cities, while the National only\n",
      "goes near Monterey, San Luis Potosi, and Toluca.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fred and I have decided to ask uncle to go by neither one route nor the\n",
      "other, but to travel by both of them, and the International line in\n",
      "addition; and this is the way we propose to do it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll go from St. Louis to Laredo because of the saving of time and\n",
      "distance, and then we'll go to Monterey, which is an interesting city,\n",
      "by the National Railway. After we've done Monterey we'll go farther on,\n",
      "to Saltillo, and there we can cross over to Jaral, about forty miles,\n",
      "and find ourselves on the main line of the International Railway. There\n",
      "the train will pick us up and carry us to Torreon, on the Mexican\n",
      "Central Railway, and from there we can continue to the capital, seeing\n",
      "the best part of the Central line, or rather of the country through\n",
      "which it runs. The northern part of the route of the Central is said to\n",
      "be dreary and uninteresting, and so we shall be able to avoid it by the\n",
      "plan we have made.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scheme was duly unfolded to the Doctor, who promptly gave his\n",
      "approval and commended the youths for the careful study they had made\n",
      "of the railway system of northern Mexico. \"Later on,\" said he, \"we will\n",
      "consider the subject of railways in other parts of Mexico, and I'm sure\n",
      "you will be able to make some interesting notes about it for your\n",
      "friends at home. Mexico was for a long time very backward in railway\n",
      "enterprises, but in the past few years she has gone ahead very rapidly.\n",
      "Ten years ago there were not five hundred miles of railway in the\n",
      "country; now there are nearly, if not quite, five thousand miles, and in\n",
      "ten years from this time there will be double that number. The Mexico of\n",
      "to-day is very different from the Mexico of a quarter of a century ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER THE MISSISSIPPI AT ST. LOUIS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Our friends stopped a day in St. Louis, and another at San Antonio,\n",
      "Texas, partly for sight-seeing purposes and partly for rest. At the\n",
      "former city the great bridge over the Mississippi excited the wonder and\n",
      "admiration of the youths, who heard with much interest the story of its\n",
      "construction and the difficulties which the engineers encountered in\n",
      "laying the foundations. At San Antonio they had their first glimpse of\n",
      "Mexican life, as the city is quite Mexican in character, and at one time\n",
      "was almost wholly so. Doctor Bronson told them that about one-third of\n",
      "the inhabitants are of Mexican origin, and they could easily believe it\n",
      "as they saw the Mexican features all about them on the streets, and\n",
      "heard the Spanish language quite as often as any other.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: THE ALAMO MISSION, SAN ANTONIO.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The object of greatest interest to them was the Alamo, the old fort\n",
      "which, in 1836, the Texans, who were fighting for independence, so\n",
      "heroically but unsuccessfully defended. They were disappointed to find\n",
      "that there is not much remaining of the fort, which originally consisted\n",
      "of an oblong enclosure, about an acre in extent, with walls three feet\n",
      "thick, and eight or ten feet high. \"There were 144 men in the Alamo, and\n",
      "they were besieged by 4000 Mexican troops under General Santa Anna,\"\n",
      "said a gentleman who accompanied them to the spot. \"The Mexicans had\n",
      "artillery, and the Texans had none, and against such odds it was\n",
      "hopeless to resist. Santa Anna sent a summons for them to surrender, and\n",
      "throw themselves upon Mexican mercy, but they refused to do so, and\n",
      "defied him and his army.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he paused a moment, Fred asked why they refused to surrender when the\n",
      "odds were so much against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They knew what Mexican mercy was,\" said the gentleman. \"It was\n",
      "illustrated not long afterwards at Goliad, where Colonel Fannin\n",
      "surrendered with 412 men as prisoners of war. They were promised to be\n",
      "released under the rules of war, and one Sunday morning, when they were\n",
      "singing 'Home, sweet home,' they were marched out and massacred, every\n",
      "man of them. The slaughter lasted from six till eight, and then the\n",
      "bodies of the slain were burned by orders of the general. It is proper\n",
      "to say that the Mexican officers were generally disgusted with the\n",
      "terrible business, but they were obliged to obey the orders of Santa\n",
      "Anna, or be themselves shot down. His policy was one of extermination,\n",
      "and he could have said on his death-bed that he left no enemies behind\n",
      "him, as he had killed them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" continued their informant, \"the siege of the Alamo began on the\n",
      "23d of February, 1836, and lasted for thirteen days. Over 200 shells\n",
      "were thrown into the fort in the first twenty-four hours, but not a man\n",
      "was injured by them, while the Texan sharp-shooters picked off a great\n",
      "number of the Mexicans. Santa Anna made several assaults, but was driven\n",
      "back each time, and it is believed that he lost fully 1500 men in the\n",
      "siege. On the morning of the 6th of March a final assault was made, and\n",
      "the fort was captured; every man was killed in the fighting excepting\n",
      "six who surrendered, and among the six was the famous Col. David\n",
      "Crockett. Santa Anna ordered all of them to be cut to pieces, and\n",
      "Crockett fell with a dozen sword-wounds after his own weapons had been\n",
      "given up. Colonel Travis, who commanded the fort, was also killed, and\n",
      "so was Colonel Bowie, who was ill in bed at the time, and was shot where\n",
      "he lay. He was the inventor of the bowie-knife, which has been famous\n",
      "through the West and South-west for a good many years. Only three\n",
      "persons were spared from death, a woman, a child, and a servant.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Less than seven weeks,\" was the reply, \"and never was there a more\n",
      "complete victory than at that battle. Gen. Sam Houston retreated slowly,\n",
      "and was followed by the Mexican army. He burned a bridge behind his\n",
      "enemies, and suddenly attacking them on the afternoon of April 21st, he\n",
      "killed half their number and captured nearly all the rest. The war-cry\n",
      "of the Texans was 'Remember the Alamo! remember Goliad!' and maddened by\n",
      "the recollection of the cruelties of the Mexicans, they fought like\n",
      "tigers, and carried everything before them. Santa Anna, disguised as a\n",
      "soldier, was captured the next day; Houston had hard work to save him\n",
      "from the fury of the Texans, but he was saved, and lived to fight again\n",
      "ten years later. But the battle of San Jacinto ended the war, and made\n",

      "A ride of a hundred and fifty miles to the south-west from San Antonio\n",
      "brought our friends to Laredo, on the banks of the Rio Grande, the\n",

      "a thinly settled country, devoted principally to grazing, and there were\n",
      "few objects of interest along the route. The time was varied with\n",
      "looking from the windows of the car, with the perusal of books, and by\n",

      "While the United States and Mexico were disputing about the boundaries,\n",
      "the Texans set up a claim for independence, and the war which was ended\n",
      "by the battle of San Jacinto was like our Revolutionary War a hundred\n",
      "and more years ago. After Texas had secured her independence, she set up\n",
      "a government of her own; she had a president and all the other officials\n",
      "pertaining to a republic, and was recognized by England, France, and\n",
      "other European countries. This did not last long, as her finances fell\n",
      "into a deplorable condition, and the preponderance of Americans among\n",
      "the population naturally led to a movement for annexation to the United\n",
      "States. Annexation was followed by war with Mexico, and it grew out of\n",
      "the old dispute about the boundaries. Mexico claimed all land west of\n",
      "the Nueces River, while Texas claimed to own as far west as the Rio\n",
      "Grande. Each country believed it was right, and our war with Mexico\n",
      "resulted in the defeat of the Mexican armies, the occupation of their\n",

      "ten millions of sheep, and horses and mules in proportion. By the census\n",
      "of 1880 it had a population of more than one and a half millions, and it\n",

      "of American and Mexican, with a few Indians by way of variety. The\n",
      "population of the frontier is quite a puzzle to the ethnologist at\n",

      "patrons of the hotel were Mexicans of the better sort, and they mingled\n",
      "freely with the Americans who had lived long enough in Texas to feel at\n",
      "home. The Texas towns along the border contain a goodly number of\n",
      "residents who are engaged in defrauding the revenue of Mexico by\n",
      "engaging in the business of smuggling goods into that country; there is\n",
      "also a fair amount of smuggling from Mexico into the United States, and\n",
      "the customs officials on both sides are kept reasonably busy in seeing\n",

      "breakfast on the following morning. As the train for Mexico started at\n",
      "eight o'clock,[2] there was not much time for sight-seeing after\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mexico is a land of high tariffs, and pretty nearly everything that can\n",
      "be imported is taxed. Machinery was formerly imported free, but it is\n",
      "now subject to duty, and so is almost everything except agricultural and\n",
      "scientific instruments and books. There is also a duty on packages apart\n",
      "from their contents, and there is a heavy duty on all kinds of\n",
      "carriages. Baggage for personal use is admitted free of duty, unless\n",
      "there is reason to suspect that the owner has an intention to sell; two\n",
      "or three suits of clothing will pass without question, but ten or twelve\n",
      "would be liable to detention and duty. The laws require that the\n",
      "examination of baggage shall be conducted 'liberally, and with prudence\n",
      "and moderation,' and certainly we have no occasion to complain of\n",
      "discourtesy. In addition to clothing 'not excessive in quantity,' a\n",
      "traveller may have two watches with their chains, a cane, an umbrella,\n",
      "one or two pistols with equipments and cartridges, one hundred cigars,\n",
      "forty small packages of cigarettes, a rifle or fowling-piece, one pound\n",
      "of smoking tobacco or snuff, and any musical instruments in actual use\n",
      "except pianos and organs. When a resident of the United States crosses\n",
      "the Rio Grande into Mexican territory with his own carriage he must pay\n",

      "it in a hand-barrow to the place where the bricks are to be spread out\n",
      "and dried, and the fourth man shapes the bricks in the mould. After\n",
      "drying somewhat while flat on the ground, which has been previously\n",

      "pressure on it. When a week has passed, another height of two feet may\n",
      "be laid, and so the work goes on until the building is finished. Then it\n",

      "a very small one. The forts were attacked first, and one after the other\n",
      "they were taken, till the only remaining one outside the city was the\n",
      "Bishop's Palace, as it was called, though it was really a fort, as we\n",
      "shall see when we get to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Partly by means of a cannon that was dragged up a hill which commanded\n",
      "the Bishop's Palace, and partly by an attack of the infantry, the place\n",
      "was captured, and our flag was over all the heights that overlooked the\n",
      "city. It had taken two days to accomplish this, and a great many of our\n",
      "soldiers had fallen, but the army had no idea of giving up the attack;\n",
      "and when they had possession of the heights, they felt as sure of the\n",
      "victory as though it was already won.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the morning of the 23d of September, the third day of the battle, a\n",
      "fire was opened on the city from the Bishop's Palace on the west, and\n",
      "from two forts on the east, and at the same time the troops on each side\n",
      "of the city began to force their way inside towards the Gran Plaza, in\n",
      "the centre. The Mexicans fought desperately, and swept the streets with\n",
      "such a fire of musketry that our men had to take shelter in the houses\n",
      "and cut their way from house to house towards the Gran Plaza. It was\n",
      "slow work, and when night came the troops had still two blocks to cut\n",
      "through before getting to the plaza. They were getting ready for work\n",
      "early the next morning when a flag of truce came from General Ampudia,\n",
      "and the city was surrendered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was the loss of the Americans in the battle?\" queried Doctor\n",
      "Bronson, as Frank paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They lost 158 killed, and 368 wounded,\" answered Fred, \"and the Mexican\n",
      "loss was said to be fully one thousand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And to what was the disparity of the losses attributed?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was thought,\" said Fred, \"at least so I read in the account\n",
      "published at that time, that the Western and South-western men who\n",
      "fought under General Taylor were better marksmen than the Mexicans. The\n",
      "Texas riflemen in particular were famous for their skill in shooting,\n",
      "and their weapons were better than those of their enemies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've made a very good short history of the capture of Monterey,\" said\n",

      "home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The youths followed this bit of practical advice, and we are permitted\n",
      "to publish their story.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time the talk about the war was ended the party had reached the\n",
      "citadel, which they visited with interest, and then proceeded to the\n",
      "Bishop's Palace, now occupied as a military barrack, and in a bad state\n",
      "of repair. While they stood looking down upon the city and the grassy\n",
      "and bushy slope of the hill, Frank recited the following piece of verse,\n",
      "which was written by Charles Fenno Hoffman shortly after the stirring\n",
      "events commemorated in the lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"We were not many--we who stood\n",

      "    Through walls of flame, its withering way;\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What is that?\" Frank asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, we must say that there was a young officer here named U. S. Grant;\n",

      "who charged up the side of the hill to the Bishop's Palace. He\n",
      "afterwards became General Grant, whom all the world knows of, and whose\n",
      "name will be remembered in America for all time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't think of that when I was talking about the battle,\" Frank\n",
      "answered, \"but I remember it all now. And I have read in one of the\n",
      "books on Mexico that he was offered promotion for his conduct in the\n",
      "battle, but declined it because another man was promoted at the same\n",
      "time. In declining the offer he said, 'If Lieutenant ---- deserves\n",
      "promotion I do not.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: OFFICERS' UNIFORMS IN 1860.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And there's another thing that needs explanation,\" continued the youth,\n",
      "\"and that is the uniform of the officers and soldiers of our army in the\n",
      "pictures of the battles in Mexico. It is quite unlike the uniform worn\n",
      "in the Civil War fifteen years later, and now in use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will explain that,\" said the Doctor, and he did so in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After peace had been declared and our army returned from Mexico, the\n",
      "War Department realized that there were certain features of the uniform\n",
      "and equipment of the men that might be changed to advantage. No action\n",
      "was taken in the matter until Jefferson Davis was Secretary of War,\n",
      "between 1853 and 1857; and I will here remark that Jefferson Davis\n",
      "commanded a regiment of Mississippi Volunteers during the Mexican War,\n",
      "and fought in this very battle of Monterey we have just been talking\n",
      "about. Well, Mr. Davis sent a circular letter to the officers of the\n",
      "army, stating that changes were contemplated, and asking for suggestions\n",
      "from them, and the inducement was held out that those who suggested\n",
      "changes which were adopted would be liberally compensated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of the circulars was received by Lieut. George H. Derby, who\n",
      "afterwards obtained considerable literary reputation as 'John Phenix.'\n",
      "Derby was a born humorist, and generally saw the ludicrous side of a\n",
      "subject before anything else. In a short time after receiving the\n",
      "circular he sent a variety of suggestions to the Department which were\n",
      "very funny, to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He designed a hat which, in addition to covering the head, could be\n",
      "used as a camp-kettle, a water-bucket, and a feed-bag for a horse, and\n",
      "with the design for the article, which was to be made of sheet-iron,\n",
      "there was a picture representing it applied to each of its proposed\n",
      "uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Instead of the shoulder cross-belts, he proposed that the soldier\n",
      "should have a leather belt around his waist, and to this belt should be\n",
      "attached a stout hook with a shank six inches long, and the point of the\n",
      "hook standing outward from the man's back. On this hook the soldier\n",
      "could hang his knapsack or equipments when on the march. He could be\n",
      "harnessed by means of it so as to drag a wagon or a cannon; and in an\n",
      "assault on a fortress he could be made to drag a scaling-ladder up the\n",
      "walls by means of this hook. Derby also proposed that the officers\n",
      "should be provided with poles like rake-handles, ten or twelve feet\n",
      "long, with rings at one end, and if a soldier should try to run away in\n",
      "battle he could be dragged back to duty by means of the hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Derby was skilful with the pencil, and he sent a sketch of a\n",
      "battle-field in which the various uses of the hook were depicted. To say\n",
      "that Jefferson Davis was angry when he read the letter is to put the\n",
      "case mildly; he turned red and blue with rage, and took the document to\n",
      "a cabinet meeting that was being held on the afternoon of the day he\n",
      "received Derby's communication. The members of the cabinet laughed over\n",
      "the suggestions and pictures, and when Davis declared he would have\n",
      "Derby cashiered for disrespect to the Secretary of War, they advised him\n",
      "to say nothing. 'If the story gets out,' said one of them, 'you'll be\n",
      "the laughingstock of the country from one end to the other, and will\n",
      "never hear the end of it. And, besides, there's some originality about\n",
      "the man, and he may yet send something that will be really useful.'\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: MOUNTAIN SCENE NEAR MONTEREY.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Davis cooled down, and the story didn't come out until years\n",
      "afterwards. The result of the recommendations of various officers of the\n",
      "army was that the old 'bellows-top' cap disappeared, and so did other\n",
      "features of the soldier's uniform and equipment. That is why the picture\n",
      "of the battle of Monterey is so unlike that of any of the battles of the\n",
      "Civil War, so far as the uniforms of officers and men are concerned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The youths had a hearty laugh over the story of Lieutenant Derby's\n",

      "On their return to the city the party visited the Alameda, which forms\n",
      "a very pretty promenade and is well shaded with trees, though Frank\n",
      "thought it appeared in rather a neglected condition. Then they drove to\n",
      "the hot springs at Topo Chico, about three miles out from the city in a\n",
      "northerly direction, and indulged in the luxury of a hot bath in natural\n",
      "water. The manager of the establishment said that the baths had a\n",
      "temperature of 106 degrees Fahrenheit, and possessed a high reputation\n",
      "for curing nervous, rheumatic, and other diseases. The arrangements for\n",
      "bathing were formerly very poor, but a new bath-house was erected in\n",
      "1887, and resulted in a great increase of patronage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course a visit was paid to the market-place, and the novelties of the\n",
      "spot received due attention. The most interesting features were the\n",
      "fruit and flower markets. Doctor Bronson told the youths that the\n",
      "Indians of Mexico had a passionate fondness for flowers long before the\n",
      "arrival of their Spanish conquerors, and it continues to the present\n",
      "time. There was a fine display of flowers, and the prices were so low\n",
      "that Frank and Fred regretted that they did not know some fair ones to\n",
      "whom they could send baskets and bouquets. Determined to do something by\n",
      "way of patronizing the flower-sellers, they bought a quantity of flowers\n",
      "and sent them to a hospital which their guide pointed out. \"They may\n",
      "serve to cheer some poor invalid,\" said Frank, \"and the market is so\n",
      "attractive that I want to encourage the trade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The semi-tropical character of Monterey was shown by the fruits, which\n",
      "seemed to comprise the principal products of two zones, the tropical\n",
      "and the temperate. There were all the fruits named in the last chapter\n",
      "as growing in the region near Lampasas, together with three or four\n",
      "others. Monterey is situated 1800 feet above the level of the sea, so\n",
      "that it is cooler than other places in the same latitude but at a lower\n",
      "elevation. Some of the fruits sold in the market of the city were not\n",
      "grown in the immediate neighborhood, but in the lower regions to the\n",
      "eastward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred called Frank's attention to the bird-sellers with their wares in\n",
      "large wooden cages, evidently of home construction. The canary seems to\n",
      "have spread pretty well over the world; his singing powers have made him\n",
      "welcome everywhere he goes, and our young friends were not at all\n",
      "surprised to find him in the market of Monterey. Several other varieties\n",
      "of singing-birds were displayed, and the prices which were asked for\n",
      "them seemed very low; but the Doctor whispered to the youths that if\n",
      "they bought anything in the market they should not offer more than a\n",
      "quarter of what was demanded, and gradually advance their figures to a\n",
      "half or possibly three-fourths. In a country where time is of no value\n",
      "everybody who has anything to sell expects to haggle about the price.\n",

      "Some of the pottery in the market was so good that the boys consulted\n",

      "of it. The Doctor checked their enthusiasm by reminding them that they\n",
      "were just then at the beginning of their journey, and it would be\n",
      "prudent to delay purchases until reaching the capital. A few jars and\n",
      "pots were selected and bargained for, more by way of practice in the\n",
      "language and customs than for any other purpose, and they were left with\n",
      "an American merchant, who undertook to ship them to New York. They were\n",
      "all of Indian workmanship, the best having come, so the dealer said,\n",
      "from Guadalajara. Mexican pottery deserves a higher rank among ceramics\n",

      "vegetables, fruits, fuel, hides, sugar, beans, wheat, iron-work, in fact\n",
      "anything and everything that has a place in a market. Donkeys are the\n",
      "beasts of burden at Monterey, and almost in the same category belong the\n",
      "_cargadores_, or porters, who are licensed and numbered exactly like\n",
      "cabs or drays in an American city. These men are identical with the\n",
      "Turkish _hamals_; they carry heavy burdens with apparent ease, and it is\n",
      "no uncommon sight to see one of them slowly creeping along with a piano,\n",
      "an iron safe, or a barrel of wine on his back, or a lighter burden on\n",
      "his head in the same way that the negro carries it. A gentleman who was\n",

      "These carts are of rude construction, and their axles are rarely, if\n",

      "1800 feet above sea-level; Saltillo is at an elevation of 5200 feet, and\n",

      "soaked in lime-water till the hull can be separated from it, and then it\n",
      "is pounded and rolled upon the metate until it is ground into meal. In\n",
      "this work the woman uses a cylinder of stone something like the American\n",
      "rolling-pin, or very often she uses a flat or slightly rounded stone,\n",
      "with which she pounds and twists for hours. When the meal is\n",
      "sufficiently ground a little water is added, and it is worked into\n",
      "dough; the dough is then rolled or patted in the hand until it is almost\n",
      "as thin as a knife-blade and formed into circular cakes. The cakes are\n",
      "baked on an iron _comal_, or griddle, which has been previously held\n",
      "over the fire until it is so hot that the cooking is done in a few\n",
      "moments. They are not allowed to brown, and are best when served hot.\n",
      "They are generally without salt or other seasoning, and are very\n",

      "simply of a wall or bank of solid adobe about two feet high, and of the\n",
      "same width; this bank was built up against one side of the kitchen,\n",
      "which was ten or twelve feet square, and it extended the whole length of\n",

      "charcoal or wood were burning; on these fires the pots, pans, and\n",
      "griddles were placed, and the process of cooking went on. There was no\n",

      "depression furnish the heat for cooking the food placed in the pots and\n",
      "kettles, which are of common unglazed earthen-ware. The cook sits or\n",

      "anywhere else. Then we take the meat of the chicken, the white part\n",
      "only, after it has been boiled very tender, and pick it into little bits\n",
      "of shreds. We take some pounded almonds, the yolks of hard-boiled eggs,\n",
      "a little bread which has been soaked in milk, a little spice of some\n",
      "kind, and plenty of pepper, and we mix the whole up together till it\n",
      "forms a hard paste. We make this paste into little balls and drop them\n",
      "into the soup when it is boiling hot and just before it is brought to\n",
      "the table.'\n",

      "something worth eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After the soup we had a _puchero_, which is said to be a very popular\n",

      "begin it by boiling mutton to make a broth, and then they throw in every\n",

      "and are largely used by the middle and upper classes. The great majority\n",
      "of Mexicans eat them twice a day, and a dinner would be incomplete\n",

      "You must remember that brigandage has been a regular occupation for\n",
      "centuries, and it cannot be broken up in a hurry. In some parts of the\n",

      "imported some Italians, who very soon turned robbers, and affiliated\n",

      "arrangement whereby a traveller can buy a letter of credit to pay his\n",

      "temptation to robbers. His expenditures are indorsed on the letter of\n",
      "credit by the company's agents, or he can draw a few dollars every night\n",
      "upon his letter to pay his hotel bill with. But it is necessary to carry\n",
      "some money in your pocket to pay the robbers for the trouble of stopping\n",
      "and examining you; if they find absolutely nothing to reward them for\n",
      "their efforts, you will very likely be killed as a warning to be more\n",
      "considerate the next time you travel. If they should rob you of your\n",

      "you obtained it, and a telegraphic transfer will be made for the amount\n",
      "remaining.\n",

      "\"Their usual plan of operations is to rush out suddenly from the\n",
      "road-side, and present pistols and guns in the faces of passengers and\n",
      "drivers, with a suddenness that prevents resistance. The passengers are\n",
      "ordered to alight, hold their hands in the air, then to lie down and\n",
      "place their mouths to the ground, and in this attitude their pockets are\n",
      "searched. The brigands are generally polite but firm, and in the\n",
      "American phrase, 'they won't stand any nonsense.' When the examination\n",
      "of pockets is completed they order the passengers to lie still for five\n",
      "or ten minutes, perhaps for a quarter of an hour, and during that time\n",
      "the fellows disappear from sight. If no resistance is offered no one is\n",
      "harmed, except once in a while when a blood-thirsty brigand kills for\n",
      "the sheer pleasure of it; but such fellows are soon apprehended, and\n",

      "robbers are concealed in the bushes all along the road-side, and the\n",

      "the day before. They met the other robbers at the place designated, and\n",
      "on presenting the pass were not interfered with in any way. My friend's\n",

      "molest his coaches or passengers. The subsidy was regularly paid, and\n",
      "the brigands faithfully regarded their side of the bargain. When\n",
      "General Scott was advancing from Vera Cruz upon the capital he made a\n",
      "contract with this same American to supply the army with beef; and\n",
      "through the efficient aid of his friends the brigands, he had no\n",
      "difficulty in carrying out his contract. They stole cattle from all the\n",

      "The road from Saltillo to Jaral follows a picturesque valley, and in the\n",
      "forty-two miles between the two places makes a descent of nearly\n",
      "fourteen hundred feet. Consequently there was more down-hill than up,\n",
      "and the diligence went along in fine style. The driver was an\n",
      "accomplished whip, and managed his team admirably. For a part of the way\n",
      "the vehicle was drawn by horses; at the first station mules were\n",
      "substituted, and our friends were unable to say which were the better\n",
      "for the work. The driver explained that he preferred mules for the\n",
      "reason that in case they ran away they would keep to the middle of the\n",
      "road, while horses were apt to shy and turn to one side, thereby\n",
      "endangering the safety of the diligence and its passengers. This\n",
      "difference between horses and mules has been noted by drivers in other\n",
      "parts of the world, and is said to be correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "The driver had an assistant, whose duty it was to throw stones at the\n",
      "leading animals to encourage them to their work. He was a skilled\n",
      "marksman and rarely missed his aim. Sometimes he threw the missiles\n",
      "while seated on the box at the driver's side, and at others he ran\n",
      "alongside the team or kept near the wheels of the coach. In either case\n",

      "\"What is the meaning of Zacatecas?\" Fred asked while the train was\n",

      "\n",
      "Neither the Doctor nor Frank could answer the question, and so the\n",

      "\n",
      "[Illustration: A SILVER-PRODUCING VALLEY.]\n",
      "\n",
      "It was found that the name was derived from a tribe of Indians called\n",
      "Zacatecas, and also from a grass that grows there, and is known in\n",
      "Mexico as _zacate_. It should be remembered that the city is the capital\n",
      "of the State of Zacatecas. As it stands in a ravine, where very little\n",
      "grass of any kind can grow, it is probable that the appellation, so far\n",
      "as the grass is concerned, belongs rather to the State than to the city,\n",
      "which is the centre of the silver-mining district.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city, which has a population of about 30,000, is anything but\n",
      "attractive, as its position in a deep ravine makes its streets very\n",
      "narrow, and crowds the buildings closely together. Its streets are badly\n",
      "paved, and it is so poorly supplied with water that the drains are not\n",
      "properly washed. Frank thought it averaged a distinct and different\n",
      "smell for each thousand of its inhabitants, and the youths were not\n",
      "surprised to learn that the mortality, especially among the poorer part\n",
      "of the population, is very great. The mountains rise all around and\n",
      "above the city, and the extent of the silver business is shown by the\n",
      "large number of buildings on the mountainsides, which mark the\n",
      "reduction-works and the entrances to the mines.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a ridge called the _Bufa_, or Buffalo, overlooking the city; it\n",
      "is the site of a little church, or chapel, that was built there more\n",
      "than a century and a half ago, and was at one time a favorite place of\n",
      "pilgrimage. Ordinary offenders were required to do penance by ascending\n",
      "on foot to the door of the chapel, and extraordinary ones made the\n",
      "journey on their knees. The custom still prevails, though less so than\n",
      "formerly. Frank and Fred saw several pilgrims making the ascent, but\n",
      "were told that days, and even weeks, might elapse before another scene\n",
      "of the same sort could be witnessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The travellers paid a hasty visit to the cathedral of Zacatecas, which\n",
      "was formerly very rich in ornaments; most of them were removed at the\n",
      "time of the confiscation of the property of the Church by the\n",
      "Government, and are not likely to be restored. It is said that the\n",
      "baptismal font was of solid silver, and worth $100,000. The Jesuits have\n",

      "enterprise to be lighted with electricity, and to have a telephone, an\n",
      "exchange, and a fire department, though the scarcity of wooden\n",

      "by ladders which are not constructed like ordinary ones, but are nothing\n",
      "more than logs set upright and notched alternately on opposite sides.\n",

      "more prudent, and suggested that they would defer their visit to the\n",

      "The patio process is in use here, as it is throughout Mexico and South\n",
      "America generally.\"\n",

      "In the hour they had at their disposal, Frank and Fred informed\n",
      "themselves on the subject, and were able to write as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: A MEXICAN ARASTRA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The patio process was invented in 1557 by BartolomÃ© de Medina, and is\n",
      "so called because a patio, or yard, is required for its operation. The\n",
      "ore is crushed and ground fine in _arastras_. An arastra is a mill where\n",
      "an animal, generally a mule, walks in a circle and turns a millstone\n",
      "that rolls upon a floor, on which the material to be ground is placed.\n",
      "We have seen arastras at work several times since we came into Mexico;\n",
      "and they are not unknown in the south-western part of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there is any gold in the ore, fifty or sixty per cent. of it may be\n",
      "saved by putting silver or copper amalgam into the arastras. Some of the\n",
      "Mexican ores must be roasted to remove certain chemicals which they\n",
      "contain, but this is not the case with all of them. The paste from the\n",
      "arastras is spread in heaps on the floor of the patio; after it has\n",
      "hardened somewhat by the evaporation of a part of the water it contains,\n",
      "it receives a quantity of salt, which is in proportion to the amount of\n",
      "silver in the ore. Then it is mixed by men with shovels and by the tread\n",
      "of horses or mules, and a day or two later a mixture of copper vitriol\n",
      "and salt is added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then follows more treading and mixing; then quicksilver is spread over\n",
      "the mass and trodden in, and the next day there is another mixing and\n",
      "treading. These performances are repeated on alternate days, quicksilver\n",
      "being added one day and the mass being trodden the next, until the\n",
      "treading has been repeated seven or eight times. The quicksilver unites\n",
      "with the silver and forms an amalgam; the formation is carefully\n",
      "watched, and when it has reached the proper condition the amalgam is\n",
      "gathered up into hide or canvas bags. Some of the quicksilver is\n",
      "squeezed out, and the rest is driven off by evaporation and condensed in\n",
      "a pipe that runs into a tub of water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a good deal more,\" said Fred, \"but I'm afraid if we say too\n",
      "much about the process we shall lead our young friends at home to skip\n",
      "the whole story. So we've made it short.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've said quite enough,\" replied the Doctor, \"to give a general idea\n",

      "Armed with the information they had obtained, the youths were able to\n",
      "understand intelligently the operations at the reduction-works that they\n",
      "visited. Frank thought they could find a cheaper way of mixing up the\n",
      "mass of ore than by treading it out with mules. Doctor Bronson told them\n",
      "that methods had been adopted in California and Nevada whereby all this\n",
      "work is done by machinery, but they were not generally approved in\n",
      "Mexico. \"The Mexicans,\" said he, \"are slow to change; they have done\n",
      "their work in this way for 300 years, and it is not easy to convince\n",
      "them that there is anything better in the world. The Americans who buy\n",
      "or lease mines in Mexico, and adopt the plans that suit themselves, will\n",
      "afford some instruction by example; the Mexicans may learn by the\n",

      "sixteen, treading out the ore. \"They are sorry-looking brutes,\" said\n",

      "mud, but to the eye of the expert I suppose it is altogether different,\n",
      "as we are told that a mining superintendent can determine almost at a\n",
      "glance how rich the mineral is. Evidently the horses don't know the\n",
      "value of what they are treading, or they wouldn't look so dejected and\n",
      "forlorn. Horses and mules that are old and useless for anything else are\n",
      "bought for this work. The chemicals destroy their hoofs, and they do not\n",

      "\"Silver was known to the Aztecs before the Spanish Conquest, but they do\n",
      "not seem to have made much use of it. They worked it into ornaments and\n",
      "various small articles, but among the treasures of Montezuma seized by\n",

      "[Illustration: BRINGING ORE FROM THE MINES.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" responded Frank; \"in the expedition commanded by Cortez there\n",
      "were many men who were familiar with the mines of Old Spain, and they\n",
      "were not long in finding the silver deposits of the New World. During\n",
      "the sixteenth century the mines of Mexico were extensively worked, and\n",
      "the working continued steadily down to the war for independence, when it\n",
      "greatly fell off. At the time of Humboldt's visit, in 1803, about 3000\n",
      "distinct mines were in operation; Humboldt estimated that the product\n",
      "of silver in Mexico from the Conquest, in 1521, down to 1804 amounted to\n",
      "$2,027,952,000, and the estimate since that time brings the grand total\n",
      "up to more than 4,000,000,000!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a lot of money!\" exclaimed Fred. \"Suppose we had it, and wanted to\n",
      "take it to New York; how could we carry it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: MEXICAN BELLOWS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a moment,\" was the reply, \"and I'll tell you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank made a hasty calculation on a slip of paper, and then answered as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Roughly estimated, the weight of that value in silver would be\n",
      "333,000,000 pounds, or 166,000 tons, estimating 2000 pounds to the ton.\n",
      "If we had it in the City of Mexico we would have to engage 416 trains of\n",
      "forty cars each, with ten tons of silver in each car, to take it to Vera\n",
      "Cruz. From Vera Cruz we would need 166 steamships carrying a thousand\n",
      "tons each, to take our precious freight to New York, and I'll let you\n",
      "figure out how many warehouses we would need to store it in, and how\n",
      "many policemen would be required to take care of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Fred, \"there's one thing you've forgotten; remember that\n",
      "the most of this silver has been brought from the mines on the backs of\n",
      "mules or donkeys. Reckoning 100 pounds to a load, how many burros would\n",
      "be needed to transport our fortune, supposing we had it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank figured again, and found that the silver product of Mexico from\n",
      "the Conquest to the present time would load three and a third million\n",
      "burros; putting them in single file, and allowing each burro ten feet of\n",
      "space, there would be 631 miles of them, and half a mile or so over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's go into the business of silver-mining,\" said Fred; \"just see\n",
      "what a lot of money has been made by it, and with very crude methods of\n",
      "reducing the ore! With the improved processes of modern times there must\n",
      "be a fortune for everybody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know about it,\" replied his cousin; \"anyway, we'll ask Doctor\n",

      "The appeal to the Doctor resulted in a good deal of sound information,\n",
      "to the effect that silver-mining is generally unprofitable, and anybody\n",
      "should think twice before venturing into it. \"And so far as the Mexican\n",
      "mines are concerned,\" he said, \"there are very few of them that are\n",
      "doing more than paying working expenses, and some do not do that. Fifty\n",
      "or more American companies are engaged in this country at present; a few\n",
      "have made money, but the majority have not yet received back what they\n",
      "put into their enterprises, or any interest upon it. And unless I am\n",
      "misinformed, it is next to impossible to buy a good mine here; if a\n",
      "Mexican has a mine he is willing to sell, you may be pretty sure it\n",
      "isn't worth buying. The same rule holds good in all mining regions the\n",
      "world over, and is hardly necessary to discuss. The mining laws of\n",
      "Mexico require that the owner of a mine must work it for four\n",
      "consecutive months in each year, with four regular miners, under\n",
      "penalty of forfeiture. Unless he complies with this law the mine\n",
      "becomes the property of the Government and is sold at auction.\n",

      "\"The laws of Mexico formerly prohibited foreigners not naturalized, or\n",
      "provided with special licenses, from owning or working mines; but this\n",

      "     been subservient to its dictatura. The priesthood has been entirely\n",
      "     free from the national courts of law, they have had courts of their\n",
      "     own, and the _fueros_, or privileges of the ecclesiastics, placed\n",
      "     them entirely beyond the reach of secular power. They levied taxes\n",
      "     and tithes of everybody and everything they had a mind to. The\n",
      "     extent to which the clergy accumulated wealth is almost incredible;\n",
      "     they are said to have possessed three-fourths of the whole property\n",
      "     of the country, consisting of lands and other real estate, rents,\n",
      "     mortgages, conventual buildings, and church ornaments. Moreover,\n",
      "     there were no bankers in Mexico except the clergy, so they had\n",

      "     \"'In 1850 SeÃ±or Lerdo de Tejara, Minister of Public Works,\n",

      "     servants connected with the religious establishments. The details\n",
      "     he gives, like the evidence of the existing churches, and the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Another writer,\" continued Doctor Bronson, \"says that the property of\n",
      "the Church included about 900 rural estates and 25,000 blocks of city\n",
      "property. When this property was confiscated and sold, the Church\n",
      "authorities warned all good Catholics not to invest in it. The result\n",
      "was that it went at very low prices, and fell into the hands of those\n",
      "who cared nothing for the religion of the former owners. The Church\n",
      "people probably see by this time that they made a mistake. Had they\n",
      "allowed Catholics to buy the confiscated property, they could have got\n",
      "it back again into their own hands with very little trouble, and at a\n",
      "small valuation. Dwelling-houses, shops, and all sorts of ordinary\n",
      "buildings, along with the rural estates and the convents, have been sold\n",
      "for secular purposes, but the church edifices proper are permitted to\n",
      "remain in the hands of their former authorities, and services go on\n",
      "there without interruption. The Laws of the Reform allow freedom of\n",
      "religious worship, and a Catholic has the same protection as the\n",
      "adherent of any other faith.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Were there any Protestant churches in Mexico before the Laws of the\n",

      "any more than the Puritans allowed a Quaker in their midst in the early\n",
      "days of the Plymouth Colony. Human nature is the same all the world\n",
      "over, and any religious body that has supreme control of a country is\n",

      "incident of the Conquest. About the year 1540 the Indians organized a\n",
      "great _cazadero_ (hunt) on this plain, to show their good-will towards\n",
      "the first viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza. A great number of them\n",
      "assembled, and the game was driven in from all directions and duly\n",
      "slaughtered by the viceroy and his friends. Hunts of this sort are of\n",
      "very ancient date; they are practised by aborigines in all parts of the\n",
      "world, and even civilized man does not disdain them. Of the civilized\n",

      "breathed heavily as it ascended the slope dragging its burden behind it.\n",
      "The speed was materially reduced from that by which the plain had been\n",

      "\n",
      "[Illustration: THE GREAT SPANISH DRAINAGE-CUT.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The top of the ascent was reached at Tula, of which we shall have\n",
      "something to say later on. Then the train entered a gorge, which Frank\n",
      "and Fred specially wished to look at. It was the Tajo de Nochistongo,\n",
      "the great Spanish drainage-cut, which was intended to save the city of\n",
      "Mexico from inundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the windows of the car they shuddered as they looked into the cut,\n",
      "and wondered if never an accident had happened from the falling away of\n",
      "the earth. The cut is twelve and a half miles in length, and is the work\n",
      "of human hands, not of nature. The railway enters the valley of Mexico\n",
      "through this cut, and the track is laid on a shelf or bench along its\n",
      "sides and high above the bottom. Our friends visited it a few days\n",
      "later, and we will here include Frank's account of what he saw and\n",
      "heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The city of Mexico stands in a valley which has no outlet, the water\n",
      "that accumulates from the rains being evaporated by the heat of the sun\n",
      "or absorbed in the volcanic soil. The city is in the lowest part of the\n",
      "valley, and is therefore liable to be overflowed whenever the\n",
      "evaporation and absorption are not sufficient to carry off the water\n",
      "that accumulates. There are several lakes that cover a tenth part of the\n",
      "area of the valley. The lowest of them is salt, as it has no outlet, but\n",
      "the others which discharge into it are fresh. This salt lake is called\n",
      "Tezcoco. It has an area of seventy-seven square miles, and its surface\n",
      "ordinarily is only two feet lower than the level of the Plaza Mayor, or\n",
      "great square of the city. In the days of the Aztecs the lake surrounded\n",
      "the city, but it is now three miles away from it, owing to the recession\n",
      "of the waters. Lake Chalco is three and a half feet higher than Tezcoco;\n",
      "while Zumpango, the most northerly of all the lakes, is twenty-nine feet\n",
      "higher than the Plaza Mayor. The lakes are separated by dikes, some of\n",
      "which were built by the Aztecs before the arrival of the Spaniards, but\n",
      "the greater number are of more recent construction, as we shall\n",
      "presently see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, it is evident that an unusual flood of water could raise Tezcoco\n",
      "so that it would flood the city, and this is what has happened on five\n",
      "different occasions--in 1553, 1580, 1604, 1607, and 1629. The last\n",
      "inundation continued for five years, and caused an immense amount of\n",
      "suffering and loss. The city was covered to a depth of three feet, and\n",
      "the waters were finally carried off by an earthquake, which allowed them\n",
      "to run away through the crevices that it formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's where we come to the history of the great cut of Nochistongo.\n",
      "The Spanish Government consulted all the celebrated engineers of the\n",
      "day, and they presented numerous plans for draining the city and\n",
      "keeping it out of danger from inundations. Enrico Martinez presented the\n",
      "plan which was adopted. It was to drain Lake Zumpango so that its waters\n",
      "would not be poured into Tezcoco, but would run to the Gulf of Mexico by\n",
      "way of Tula. For this purpose he proposed to make a tunnel through\n",
      "Nochistongo, to carry off the superfluous water of Zumpango, or, rather,\n",
      "of the river Cuatitlan, which flows into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: YOUNG GIRLS OF TULA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The tunnel was commenced in November, 1607, but when completed it was\n",
      "found insufficient to drain the lake, and a new plan was needed. A Dutch\n",
      "engineer was then brought in, and he naturally proposed a system of\n",
      "dikes, similar to those of his own country and the dikes already built\n",
      "by the Aztecs. He was allowed to carry out his scheme until the arrival\n",
      "of a new viceroy in 1628. The new viceroy would not believe the accounts\n",
      "which he heard of the floods that had occurred, and he ordered Martinez\n",
      "to stop up the tunnel and allow the waters to take their original\n",
      "course. He was soon convinced of his error, and ordered the tunnel to be\n",
      "reopened. It was reopened and continued in use until the following June,\n",
      "when Martinez found that it was being destroyed by the pressure of the\n",
      "water, and he therefore closed it to save it from ruin. A disastrous\n",
      "flood followed, and this was the one that lasted five years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did the people get around in that time?\" Fred asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They were forced to use boats,\" was the reply; \"but the getting about\n",
      "was the least part of the trouble caused by the flood. Most of the\n",
      "houses were of adobe, and these soon crumbled and fell. The loss was so\n",
      "great that the Spanish Government ordered the site of the city to be\n",
      "changed to higher ground, but on representations by the City Council of\n",
      "the value of the permanent structures which would thus be rendered\n",
      "useless, the order was countermanded. The city was restored after the\n",
      "subsidence of the waters. It has been threatened several times since,\n",
      "but though it has been in great danger the cut and the dikes have saved\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how about the making of the tunnel into a cut?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They put Martinez in prison as soon as the flood came, and he was kept\n",
      "there for several years. Then it was determined to change the tunnel\n",
      "into a cut, and he was released and put in charge of the work. It took\n",
      "150 years to make it, and though nominally finished in 1789, it has\n",
      "never been entirely completed. Thousands of Indians died during the work\n",
      "of digging this enormous ditch. It was the greatest earthwork of its\n",
      "time, and in fact the greatest down to the cutting of the Suez and\n",
      "Panama canals. Here are the figures:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Length of the cut, 67,537 feet; greatest depth, 197 feet; greatest\n",
      "breadth, 361 feet. The original tunnel of Martinez was four miles long,\n",
      "eleven and a half feet wide, and fourteen feet high. Portions of the old\n",
      "tunnel, or rather of its ruins, are visible to-day. There is a monument\n",
      "to the memory of Martinez, which was erected a few years ago in one of\n",
      "the public squares of the capital city; it might possibly console him\n",
      "for his five years in prison if he could only come around and look at\n",
      "it.\"\n",

      "As Frank paused, Doctor Bronson took up the subject and said that even\n",
      "with the waters of Zumpango drained away there was still a liability of\n",
      "the overflow of the lower lakes. He added that numerous projects had\n",
      "been proposed. Some engineers were in favor of drying up Tezcoco\n",
      "altogether by turning away the waters that flow into it; others advised\n",
      "draining the waters into a lower part of the valley, if such could be\n",
      "found; and others again proposed a long and large tunnel through the\n",
      "mountains at so low a level that Tezcoco and the city could be\n",
      "thoroughly drained. To this should be added a canal from the upper lakes\n",
      "to flow through the city and wash out its sewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What will be done about it no one can safely predict,\" the Doctor\n",
      "remarked. \"The city is badly drained, its sewage is only partially\n",
      "carried away, and such of it as the water removes is accumulated in Lake\n",
      "Tezcoco, which is becoming dirtier and more shallow every year. No plan\n",
      "has been proposed that has been pronounced successful, or to which there\n",
      "is not a serious objection. Of course almost anything could be done with\n",
      "unlimited money, but Mexico, like other cities and countries, has a\n",
      "limit to the amount that might be expended for any given purpose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The smells that greeted the nostrils of the youths on their arrival at\n",
      "the capital convinced them that the drainage of Mexico is little better\n",
      "than no drainage at all. Fred remarked that if it were anywhere else\n",
      "than in the very high region where it is (7602 feet above the sea), it\n",
      "would have no need of drainage, as all the inhabitants would die of\n",
      "pestilence.\n",

      "Emerging from the famous earth-cutting, our friends had their first view\n",
      "of the snowy peaks of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, the great volcanoes\n",
      "which lie to the east of the city of Mexico. They had read and heard\n",
      "much of these famous mountains, and had formed many mental pictures of\n",
      "them. To the credit of the volcanoes, it is proper to say that they\n",
      "fully came up to the expectations which had been formed of them.\n",

      "The train sped on over the comparatively level region of the valley. For\n",
      "several miles the Mexican Central Railway lies parallel to the Mexican\n",
      "National line, and as there happened to be a train on the other track,\n",
      "the passengers had the exhilaration of a race as a concluding feature of\n",
      "their journey.\n",

      "They had left Queretaro a little before noon; it was seven o'clock in\n",

      "Doctor Bronson had telegraphed for a courier from the Hotel del Jardin\n",
      "to meet them at the station, and the man was there in accordance with\n",
      "his request. The key of one of the trunks was given up to meet the\n",
      "requirements of the local custom-house, after the manner of the _octroi_\n",
      "of Paris and other Continental cities. Our friends had found this\n",
      "regulation at all the towns where they had stopped on their route, but\n",

      "assurance that they contained no merchandise.\n",

      "The Hotel del Jardin proved to be quite satisfactory, so far as the\n",
      "rooms were concerned, but there was not much to be said in favor of the\n",
      "supper to which the travellers sat down, after removing the dust from\n",
      "their garments and making themselves generally presentable. The boys\n",
      "ascertained on inquiry that the hotel was built around the garden of an\n",
      "old convent, and that a portion of it was really the convent edifice.\n",
      "Some of the rooms are the former cells of the monks, and the youths\n",

      "If all stories, or even a quarter of those that are told, are true, the\n",

      "that there were many honest and conscientious men among them, but there\n",
      "is also little, if any, room for doubt that a great many men entered the\n",
      "monasteries with hardly a spark of religious feeling about them, solely\n",
      "for the purpose of getting a living without working for it. The number\n",
      "of idlers among them was fully equal to the proportion to be found in\n",
      "the ministry of the Church of England. A union of Church and State,\n",
      "whether Protestant or Catholic, is certain to develop a large number of\n",

      "During their stay in the city of Mexico our friends found that it was\n",
      "the better plan not to stipulate to take their meals in the hotel where\n",
      "they had their rooms. They breakfasted, dined, and supped wherever they\n",
      "pleased, and found the arrangement very satisfactory. In this way they\n",

      "the most of it. Rather incongruously, these dealers in sacred things\n",

      "They offer to sell you the ticket that will be sure to draw the highest\n",

      "Government gives charters to certain associations, and very often runs\n",

      "Frank did not invest in the lottery, but he went to witness one of the\n",
      "drawings. It took place in public, and seemed to be perfectly fair. The\n",
      "numbers were drawn from the boxes by blind boys, who were brought from\n",
      "one of the hospitals for the blind, and were accompanied by the\n",

      "announced, there is intense excitement. There is an old adage that\n",

      "Monterey and elsewhere in the north. The city offered no exception to\n",
      "the rule, and the size and beauty of the bouquets, combined with their\n",
      "low price, were calculated to astonish the visitors. For twenty-five\n",
      "cents Frank bought a bouquet, which he sent to Doctor Bronson's room. It\n",

      "principally of roses of a dozen varieties. While Frank was paying for\n",
      "his purchase Fred sniffed at it, and was surprised to find that in spite\n",
      "of their beauty the roses had hardly any perfume. On inquiry, he learned\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It is a magnificent building, and would do honor to any of the capitals\n",

      "the Aztec city that stood here, and built their own upon its ruins, and\n",
      "where now stands the cathedral the Teocalli, or temple of the Aztecs,\n",
      "was formerly to be seen. It is saddening to think of the rivers of blood\n",
      "that flowed here in the sacrifices which the Aztecs deemed necessary to\n",
      "their religious exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The historical authorities say generally that 60,000 persons were\n",
      "slaughtered in a single year on the altars of the Great Teocalli of\n",
      "Tenochtitlan (the Aztec city that stood here and was destroyed by the\n",
      "Spaniards); most of them were prisoners of war, but when there was not a\n",

      "of the people they conquered, but they did well to put a stop to this\n",
      "terrible shedding of blood in the name of religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Teocalli was a pyramid of earth, faced with stone, and is said to\n",
      "have been 150 feet in height. Steps led around and up its sides, and\n",
      "they were so arranged that in mounting to the top the pedestrian made a\n",
      "complete circuit of the structure. On the summit was the sacrificial\n",
      "altar, and this is supposed to have been very nearly where the centre of\n",
      "the cathedral is at present. The sacrificial stone from the Teocalli is\n",
      "now in the museum; it is shaped like a millstone, is three feet high by\n",
      "nine in diameter, and is elaborately carved on the sides and upper\n",

      "up the neighboring canal; then a small church was erected, and followed\n",
      "by a larger one, and this again was removed in 1573 to make room for the\n",
      "present cathedral, which was completed ninety-four years later at an\n",
      "expense of $2,000,000. It stands on the eastern side of the Plaza Mayor,\n",
      "and is a very conspicuous object in the panorama of the city. Like most\n",
      "Catholic cathedrals, it is in the shape of a cross, its greatest length\n",
      "being 426 feet, and its greatest width 200 feet. It is 175 feet high,\n",

      "no smoke to mar the view, and we readily traced the streets and avenues,\n",
      "stippled with the green of the squares and gardens that abound so\n",
      "numerously. We looked over the plains and down upon the lakes, and then\n",

      "days later he was shot by order of the military commander; as he fell he\n",

      "was 365 days. Each four years had different emblems repeated\n",
      "successively, without reference to other chronological arrangements. The\n",
      "first year was called _tochtl_, or rabbit; the second, _acatl_, or reed;\n",
      "the third, _tecpatl_, or flint; the fourth, _calli_, or house. In\n",

      "thirteen, four of such periods making fifty-two years, or a Mexican age,\n",
      "when the Festival of Fire occurred. This was a most serious event for\n",

      "The performance is repeated monthly for six months, and then the goods\n",

      "opposition to it at first, but a short trial showed that it was much\n",
      "more economical than the old system. There is a good service of funeral\n",
      "cars, and they are graduated to suit all purses that have any money at\n",
      "all in them. The range of prices is from three to one hundred and twenty\n",
      "dollars; for the lowest sum a single car drawn by a mule is supplied,\n",
      "and for the highest figure one may have a hearse-car, gorgeously draped,\n",
      "plumed, and liveried, drawn by a pair of black horses, and with\n",
      "attendants appropriately liveried and of most solemn countenance. The\n",
      "hearse-car is followed by two, and perhaps three cars, containing the\n",
      "mourners, friends of the deceased, and others, who go to make up the\n",
      "funeral cortÃ©ge, and these cars are as appropriately draped as the\n",
      "hearse. Ranging between the highest and lowest figures are half a dozen\n",
      "or even more 'outfits,' so that any desires can be met.\n",

      "with black are sent to relatives and friends. There is a fashionable\n",
      "card form for a funeral as much so as for a wedding, and it would be a\n",
      "great social blunder to vary from the conventional style. Friends and\n",
      "relatives must respond to these cards, and any one who has a large\n",

      "father or mother dies, her companions put on mourning for fifteen days;\n",
      "if the girl herself dies they go into mourning for a month. The same\n",
      "rule holds throughout society, and there is also a rule that when one\n",
      "visits a house where the family is in mourning, the visitor must be\n",
      "costumed in mourning also. The result is that fashionable people are in\n",

      "_planchadora_, ironing-woman. The most important servant is the\n",
      "_portero_, who has general charge of the house, and sometimes of a large\n",
      "building in which several families live. He is the exact counterpart of\n",
      "the German door-keeper, and, like him, generally lives with his family\n",

      "their food, and in some cases all of it. At least this is the theory,\n",
      "though the practice is that the employer really supports them, though\n",
      "indirectly. Servants are nearly always in debt to their employers, and\n",
      "this state of affaire is encouraged by law, as they are not allowed to\n",
      "leave a place as long as they are in debt. The only way in which this\n",

      "heavily to somebody for his influence with the authorities. Matters are\n",

      "on the mats along the floor of the dormitory, so that there must be very\n",

      "fact, it is generally the first drive taken by a visitor, and he is\n",
      "pretty certain to be favorably impressed with it. Chapultepec was a\n",
      "royal residence before the Conquest; during the Spanish rule it was the\n",
      "home of the viceroys, and since that time the President of the republic\n",
      "has generally lived there when he could live at all in the city or its\n",

      "well to try both means of making the visit. If he is an equestrian he\n",
      "will hire a saddle-horse, and make the excursion on horseback between\n",
      "seven and nine o'clock in the morning, when it is the fashion to appear\n",
      "thus on the Paseo. Doctor Bronson and his young friends followed the\n",
      "prevailing custom, and through the aid of the manager of the hotel were\n",
      "satisfactorily provided with steeds. But they were very modestly mounted\n",
      "in comparison with some of the Mexican equestrians, whose saddles and\n",
      "saddle-cloths were elaborately ornamented and said to have cost all the\n",
      "way from one to two thousand dollars each. Some of the horsemen were\n",
      "armed with sabres and revolvers--a souvenir of a custom which is no\n",
      "longer necessary, but was emphatically so not many years ago. The road\n",
      "to Chapultepec, and indeed the roads anywhere in the suburbs, were\n",
      "infested with brigands, who used to rise up from unexpected spots as\n",

      "\n",
      "The enterprising brigands were not content with robbing people on\n",
      "horseback or in carriages, but occasionally devoted their energies to\n",
      "kidnapping residents and holding them for ransom. As an illustration of\n",
      "their performances Frank made note of the following story:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One evening while a gentleman was at dinner with his family, in the\n",
      "suburb of Tacuba, a party of brigands appeared and commanded silence on\n",
      "the part of all under pain of death. They harmed no one, and did not rob\n",
      "the house, but they hurried the gentleman into a carriage, and drove\n",
      "away with him. It was naturally supposed that he had been taken to a\n",
      "place of concealment among the foot-hills of the mountains that encircle\n",
      "the valley; but it turned out that his captors drove directly to the\n",
      "city and secreted their victim in the cellar of a house. There he was\n",
      "kept for several days, until the police were so closely on the track of\n",
      "the kidnappers that they fled and left him to make his escape.\n",
      "Subsequently they were captured and executed; but the circumstance was\n",
      "not at all a pleasant one for suburban residents to contemplate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred observed that the Paseo de la Reforma begins at the equestrian\n",
      "statue of Charles IV., very nearly a mile from the Plaza Mayor. It may\n",
      "also be said to begin at the Alameda, a beautiful garden of poplar and\n",
      "other trees, and occupying a historic site. The Alameda includes the\n",
      "ancient Indian market-place and the Plaza del Quemadero, where the\n",
      "victims of the Inquisition were burned to death on a stone platform\n",
      "which was long since removed. Successive viceroys improved it, and\n",
      "within the last few decades it has been planted with flowers and\n",
      "otherwise beautified, so that it is now a very attractive spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statue of Charles IV. is a fine work of art, and notable as the\n",
      "first bronze casting of any magnitude on this side of the Atlantic;\n",
      "Humboldt pronounced it second only to the statue of Marcus Aurelius, and\n",
      "it has received the unstinted praise of many critics who have seen it.\n",
      "It was cast in 1802, and placed upon its pedestal in the following year.\n",
      "During the War for Independence it was, in 1822, covered with a large\n",
      "globe of boards painted blue, and in this condition it remained for two\n",
      "years, when it was taken down and placed in the court-yard of the\n",
      "University. In 1852, when the hostility to the Spaniards had somewhat\n",
      "abated, the statue was restored to its pedestal, and has peacefully\n",
      "rested there ever since. The casting is in a single piece, and weighs\n",
      "thirty tons, and the height of horse and rider is only a few inches less\n",

      "From the foot of the statue to the base of Chapultepec is a distance of\n",
      "3750 yards; the Paseo de la Reforma runs straight as a sunbeam along\n",
      "this measured length, and it has a width, including the sidewalks, of\n",
      "fifty-six yards. At regular distances there are _glorietas_, circular\n",
      "spaces like the _Rond-Point_ of the Champs-ElysÃ©es, in Paris, which are\n",
      "intended for statues of men eminent in the history of Mexico; one of\n",
      "them is already occupied with a statue of Columbus, who is represented\n",
      "drawing away the veil that hides the New World. At the corners of the\n",
      "pedestal are four life-size figures in bronze, and Frank and Fred were\n",
      "pleased to observe that one of them represented the good missionary Las\n",
      "Casas, who labored earnestly for the protection of the Indians. A statue\n",
      "of Guatemozin, the last of the Aztec kings, is destined for the next\n",
      "space, but had not been erected at the time of the visit of our friends;\n",
      "the third space was intended for a statue of Cortez, and the fourth for\n",
      "one of Juarez. The occupants of the other glorietas had not been named,\n",
      "but they will be men famous in the history of Mexico. From present\n",
      "indications Maximilian is not likely to be chosen as one of the heroes\n",
      "to be preserved in bronze. The glorietas are 400 feet in diameter, and\n",
      "surrounded with stone benches for the accommodation of pedestrian\n",
      "visitors.\n",

      "The Paseo is lined with shade-trees, so that it affords pleasant walks;\n",
      "the centre of the road-way is reserved for people on horseback, while\n",
      "the carriages move along the sides. On pleasant afternoons the vehicles\n",
      "are so numerous that the police have sufficient occupation to keep them\n",
      "in proper line, and the turnout is a fine one in every way. Frank and\n",
      "Fred compared the display one afternoon with that of London, Paris, and\n",
      "New York, under similar circumstances, and after careful consideration\n",
      "they agreed that the Mexican pageant was more attractive than any one of\n",
      "the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The ground is level, the road finely macadamized, and the way perfectly\n",
      "straight; the horses and carriages are the best that can be procured;\n",

      "are picturesque; the ladies are handsomely attired, and many of them\n",

      "the city with water, as they are in sight from this drive. One comes\n",
      "from back among the hills near the old convent of El Desierto, and the\n",
      "other leads from a great spring at the foot of Chapultepec. The latter\n",
      "aqueduct gave shelter to our soldiers during their attack on the gates\n",
      "of the city after the storming of the castle; from one pillar to another\n",

      "them we'll mention that an American company proposes to make an\n",
      "extension of the city of Mexico by building a suburb on the level tract\n",
      "of land through which the Paseo runs. This was one of the dreams of\n",
      "Maximilian, but he had no time or opportunity to put it into practical\n",
      "shape. His idea has been taken up by the peaceful invaders from the\n",
      "North, and if it is carried out as they propose, it will not be many\n",
      "years before the land is materially transformed. Artesian wells have\n",
      "been sunk in this level space and have found an abundance of water, and\n",
      "the projectors of the suburb say they will have their own supply without\n",
      "depending upon either of the aqueducts.\"\n",

      "public resort, a royal or Presidential residence, or for the panoramic\n",
      "view presented to the visitor as he looks from its top. It is an\n",
      "isolated rock, or hill, rising about 200 feet, and with a length of 1000\n",
      "or 1200 feet, and the top is crowned with the buildings, which have seen\n",
      "many changes among their occupants as well as in themselves. The sides\n",
      "are steep in some places, but gradual in others, the steep parts\n",
      "predominating. All around the base are cypress-trees, whose age is\n",
      "unknown; but they are certainly very old; and their venerable appearance\n",
      "is increased by the moss that depends from their limbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The tree of the greatest interest to us was that which bears the name\n",
      "of Montezuma. If tradition is correct, the Emperor sat beneath its\n",
      "shade; and it was possibly while resting here that he received the news\n",
      "of the approach of those strange white men who had landed upon the\n",
      "coast, and rode upon animals the like of which were never before known\n",
      "in America. It is a wonderful tree 170 feet high, and forty-six in\n",
      "circumference. Like the other great trees of Chapultepec, it is a\n",
      "cypress; and like the others, too, it is heavily draped with moss, as\n",
      "though in mourning for the aboriginal ruler, whose kingdom was torn away\n",
      "by the invader.\n",

      "[Illustration: EL SALTO DEL AQUA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From the tree of Montezuma we went to his bath, which is not far away,\n",
      "and is the famous spring that fills the aqueduct already mentioned. The\n",
      "water is cool and clear, and supplied the ancient Tenochtitlan, just as\n",
      "in later days it was made to supply the Spanish city which rose on the\n",
      "site of the Aztec one. The aqueduct through which the water flows is\n",
      "exactly on the line of that of the Aztecs. The Spanish aqueduct was\n",
      "begun in 1677, and has 904 arches from its starting-point at Chapultepec\n",
      "to its terminus in the Salto del Agua, or Water-fall, in the city. The\n",
      "water of Chapultepec is called _agua delgada_, or thin water; while that\n",
      "supplied by the San Cosme aqueduct is _agua gorda_, or thick water. From\n",
      "time immemorial the spring has been flowing, and it is supposed to be\n",
      "fed by underground channels from the mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After the tree and the baths we visited the palace, or such part of it\n",
      "as was open to the public. There is not much worth seeing inside the\n",
      "building, the most interesting feature about it being the view from the\n",
      "roof. All the Valley of Mexico, with its girdle of mountains, was before\n",
      "us; it was like the view from the cathedral tower, with the difference\n",
      "that the city formed a part of the horizontal view in one direction,\n",
      "while from the tower it lay beneath and around our feet; and the same\n",
      "view that included the city embraced also the snowy peaks of\n",
      "Popocatepetl and the 'White Woman,' which lay a little to the right of\n",
      "the cluster of domes and roofs standing between us and the silvery sheet\n",
      "of Tezcoco. In the opposite direction was Tacuba, the spot where Cortez\n",
      "thought of rebuilding the city which was to rise in place of the\n",
      "Tenochtitlan he had destroyed. It is to be regretted that he did not do\n",
      "so, as the site is better adapted to a city; it admits of good drainage,\n",

      "in their maps of the valley the hill is represented with a grasshopper\n",
      "as large as itself perched on the top. We are wondering whether they\n",

      "corresponding extent. Then the King had granaries of immense extent, to\n",
      "guard against suffering in case of famine; and there were armories with\n",
      "weapons sufficient for a military force of thousands. The halls of the\n",
      "palace were spacious, and the royal dining-table was supplied with\n",
      "delicacies of all kinds from every part of the dominions. Fresh fish\n",
      "were provided daily by a line of couriers in the same way that they\n",
      "were supplied to the Khan of Tartary in the days of Marco Polo, and also\n",
      "to the royal table of Japan. According to the accounts, the runners made\n",

      "which were the first ever seen in America. This was the force with which\n",

      "\"He at once took Montezuma prisoner, and having captured the men who\n",
      "attacked Vera Cruz, he burned them alive in the public square in front\n",
      "of the palace. Montezuma took the oath of allegiance to the King of\n",
      "Spain, and was set at liberty after paying an enormous amount of gold\n",
      "and precious stones by way of ransom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as Cortez thought everything was quiet he learned that the\n",
      "Governor of Cuba had sent an army under Narvaez to deprive him of the\n",
      "command of the country. As the army was much larger than his own, the\n",
      "situation was desperate; but Cortez was equal to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He left 200 men in the city under charge of one of his officers, and\n",
      "then hastened to the coast, where he defeated and killed Narvaez, and\n",
      "added his men to his own forces. Thus the army of 900 men, with eighty\n",
      "horses and twelve pieces of artillery, that had been sent to conquer\n",
      "Cortez became really his reinforcement. He returned with them to Mexico,\n",
      "where, meantime, the people had risen against the Spaniards, killed\n",
      "Montezuma, and under their new emperor, Cuitlahua, driven the invaders\n",
      "out of the city. If you want a brilliant account of the evacuation of\n",
      "the city, you will find it in Prescott's History; it is too long to be\n",
      "given here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a reminiscence of the terrible retreat,\" continued Fred,\n",
      "\"which is shown to every visitor to the city. It is the Salto de\n",
      "Alvarado, or Alvarado's Leap, in the street which bears the name of that\n",
      "warrior. They tell us that where the line of house-fronts is broken, and\n",
      "shut off by an iron railing, was formerly a canal in the ancient city of\n",
      "Tenochtitlan. This is said to be the exact spot where Alvarado leaped\n",
      "across the canal, and saved himself from the death which overtook so\n",
      "many of his comrades. He commanded the rear-guard, and was one of the\n",
      "few who escaped. Bernal Diaz says the opening was so wide, and the sides\n",
      "so high, that no man in the world could have jumped across, no matter\n",
      "how strong might be his limbs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we are coming to the Noche Triste tree,\" remarked Frank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" answered Fred. \"Cortez is said to have sat all night under this\n",
      "tree at the time of the evacuation, lamenting over his misfortunes and\n",
      "laying plans for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think it is really so?\" Fred asked, turning to Doctor Bronson.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The legend is a romantic one,\" the Doctor replied, \"and I would not\n",
      "care to disturb it; but if I read the character of Cortez correctly, he\n",
      "was not the man to sit down and mourn under any circumstances. Quite\n",
      "likely he stopped under the tree on that eventful night of July 1, 1520;\n",
      "but it is more probable that he was planning what to do next instead of\n",
      "wasting his time in vain lamentations. It is time to go now,\" said he,\n",
      "glancing at his watch, \"and we'll have the rest of the story at the foot\n",
      "of the famous tree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred folded his manuscript and consigned it to his pocket, and then the\n",
      "trio, accompanied by their guide, proceeded to Popotla by the railway.\n",
      "Taking a car at the west side of the Plaza Mayor, they reached Popotla\n",
      "in little more than half an hour from the time of their departure. They\n",
      "passed through Tacuba, which was anciently an important town, but is now\n",
      "a suburb of the great city, with a population of between two and three\n",
      "thousand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tree is a species of cedar, called _Ahuehuete_ by the Indians, and\n",
      "_Sabino_ by the Spaniards. Down to a few years ago it was in fine\n",
      "condition, but one night a fire was kindled against it and seriously\n",
      "injured its trunk. Several of its limbs have since died and been\n",
      "removed; and to prevent its utter destruction by relic-hunters, the tree\n",
      "has been surrounded by an iron railing, and is carefully watched by a\n",
      "policeman. Visitors may pick up any twigs lying outside the railing, but\n",
      "they are forbidden to tear anything from the tree, however\n",
      "insignificant.\n",
      "\n",
      "After inspecting the tree, and commenting upon the fact that it was\n",

      "the Conquest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"During the retreat,\" continued Fred, \"the rear-guard of the Spaniards\n",
      "was destroyed; the retreat lasted for six days, and then a battle was\n",
      "fought, on the 7th of July, 1520, on the plains of Otumba. Here Cortez\n",
      "was victorious, but he was not strong enough to attempt to retake the\n",
      "city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He went to Tlascala, where he assembled a large force of natives, and\n",
      "again marched upon the capital. Meantime the Mexicans prepared for\n",

      "was turned away unbelieved and almost unheard. The Virgin appeared to\n",
      "him again, and told him to gather some roses from the top of the rock\n",
      "and carry them in his blanket to the bishop. He did so, and when the\n",
      "blanket was opened the picture of Mary was found to be painted upon it,\n",
      "and surrounded by the imprint of the roses. The bishop was incredulous\n",
      "at first, but when he reflected that the Indian could not paint, and was\n",
      "too poor to employ an artist, he accepted the miracle, and it was soon\n",
      "after adopted by the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was not easy to identify the spot, and so the Virgin appeared again\n",
      "and stamped her foot upon the ground. Immediately there burst forth a\n",

      "carried away, but afterwards returned. The altar railing, of solid\n",

      "\"The decree by which the Inquisition was established in Mexico\n",
      "especially exempted the Indians from its operations, and thereby secured\n",
      "its popularity among them, as the public burning of Spanish and other\n",
      "heretics afforded much amusement to the natives, and was a sort of\n",
      "substitute for the human sacrifices of the Aztecs, which the Conquest\n",
      "had abolished. The Mexican Inquisition was under the special charge of\n",
      "the Dominican order, the same as in Spain, and hence was associated with\n",

      "\"There is,\" continued the Doctor, \"a popular misapprehension concerning\n",
      "the _auto-da-fÃ©_, or profession of faith. It is generally believed to be\n",
      "the burning of the condemned, whereas the _auto-da-fÃ©_ was simply the\n",
      "public ceremony that followed the secret trial by the Inquisition. The\n",
      "members of the tribunal, and all others assembled with them, made a\n",
      "public _auto-da-fÃ©_, or profession of their faith in Christianity and\n",
      "the doctrines of the Church. After this was done the list of the\n",
      "condemned was read, together with the punishments accorded to them, and\n",
      "then the victims were handed over to the civil authorities for\n",

      "burnings were frequent. How many people perished in these affairs is not\n",
      "known; but it must not be understood that all the victims who suffered\n",
      "were burned alive. In most instances, even where the body of the\n",
      "condemned man was burned, he was killed by strangling; thus in one case\n",

      "thorn. Several times a day they sat down and feasted in front of him,\n",
      "called him every mean name their language contained, and heaped all\n",
      "sorts of insults upon him. They kept this up for sixty days; if he lost\n",

      "sum as he goes along. The arriero will want to be paid in advance, a\n",

      "deadly poison; it will produce death or insanity, according to the size\n",

      "administered. There is a popular belief among the Mexicans that the\n",
      "insanity of the ex-Empress Carlotta was caused by this poison. While\n",
      "many deny this and point to the fact that she became insane after going\n",
      "to Europe, they admit that the palo de leche is to be feared when in the\n",
      "hands of unscrupulous persons. On the other hand, it is claimed that the\n",

      "hence the workman 'square' the logs roughly as soon as they have been\n",

      "liable to roll while upon the rough carts by which they are brought\n",

      "convent that has been converted into a public hospital. As the\n",
      "passengers emerged from the station Frank and Fred were impressed with\n",
      "the listlessness of the cab-drivers, who did not seem to care whether\n",
      "they obtained customers or not. They stood or sat idly near their\n",

      "The carriages in waiting were of various kinds. That which first caught\n",
      "the eyes of the youths was a _calesa_, a sort of chaise carrying two\n",
      "persons, the driver being seated on the horse; the shafts were of\n",
      "unusual length, and the weight was so placed that fully one-third of it\n",
      "rested on the animal, in addition to that of the driver. The wood-work\n",
      "was bright with paint and gilding, and over the frame was drawn a cover\n",
      "of white linen to ward off rain and dust together with the heat of the\n",
      "sun, which is by no means light in Yucatan. Fred suggested that it was a\n",
      "wise provision of nature to seat the driver on the horse, as he could\n",
      "not conveniently go to sleep there.\n",
      "\n",
      "A somewhat rickety carriage to hold four persons was secured, and in\n",
      "this conveyance the travellers proceeded to the only hotel of which\n",
      "Merida can boast. Until recently the place had no hotel whatever, and\n",
      "strangers were obliged to hunt lodgings for themselves or apply to their\n",
      "consular representative or a foreign merchant. Even as it is, a letter\n",
      "of introduction to a resident is a very useful document. Few travellers\n",
      "go to Merida, and the universal testimony of those who have been there\n",
      "is that the residents are hospitable. The same may be said generally of\n",
      "the inhabitants of the towns, villages, and haciendas throughout\n",
      "Yucatan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The streets of Merida are broader than those of many other Mexican\n",
      "cities, but their pavement does not attract attention by its excellence.\n",
      "The houses are of stone, and mostly but a single story in height. The\n",
      "entrance is generally through an arched door-way into a court-yard, and\n",
      "the windows that face the street are invariably grated and nearly all\n",
      "without glass. The construction of the houses suggests Moorish and\n",
      "Spanish architecture, together with some features peculiar to the\n",

      "\n",
      "Merida stands on the site of a native city, where a great and decisive\n",
      "battle was fought in 1540. According to the Spanish historians, there\n",
      "were 200 Spaniards against 40,000 Indians. Doubtless the figures are not\n",
      "exact, but it is quite likely that the defeated army was vastly superior\n",
      "in numbers to the invaders. The Spaniards had, of course, the advantage\n",
      "of fire-arms, as they had in the conquest of Mexico, and we have seen in\n",
      "previous pages what a great advantage it was. The Indians had only\n",
      "spears, swords, and bows and arrows, and their bodily defences were\n",
      "tunics of wadded cotton. These tunics were efficient against their own\n",
      "kind of weapons, but of little use to repel a musket-ball. The cannon of\n",
      "the Spaniards created terrible havoc among them, and one chronicler says\n",

      "Where is now the Plaza Mayor was a mound of stone and earth at the time\n",
      "of the Conquest. On the top of the mound was an altar, on which\n",
      "sacrifices were made; but the natives were not as much addicted to them\n",
      "as were the people of Mexico. This very circumstance had much to do with\n",
      "the success of Cortez in his conquest. The Aztecs sought to take their\n",
      "enemies alive in order to sacrifice them on their altars; and it is said\n",
      "that Cortez himself was in their hands on two occasions. They might\n",
      "easily have killed him, but while they were leading him away uninjured,\n",
      "in order that he should be kept for sacrifice, he was rescued by his\n",

      "\n",
      "The mound referred to was torn down for the sake of the building\n",
      "material it contained; and the same was the case with many other mounds\n",

      "Merida is constructed was obtained from these edifices.\n",

      "The streets cross each other at right angles, and Frank observed\n",
      "something which he thought quite original in the naming of the streets.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"For the convenience of the Indians who could not read or write Spanish,\n",
      "or anything else, in fact, the streets were named after birds and\n",
      "beasts. In addition to the Spanish name in letters there was the figure\n",
      "of the creature after which the street was called. The Street of the Ox\n",
      "had the figure of an ox in stone or plaster, or painted on the wall; the\n",
      "Street of the Flamingo presented a tall flamingo with a beak of fiery\n",
      "red, and the Street of the Elephant had a well-moulded figure of that\n",

      "surprised it has been so little utilized.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is utilized more than you think,\" said Doctor Bronson, when Frank\n",
      "called his attention to the subject. \"You remember that in Russia and\n",
      "other countries where large numbers of the population cannot read, the\n",
      "shop-keepers ornament their signs with pictures of the things they have\n",

      "watch-maker hangs out a wooden watch, a boot-maker displays a boot or\n",
      "shoe, and a druggist shows a mortar and pestle. You remember how\n",
      "convenient it was in the far East, for the servants who did not know a\n",
      "single Roman letter, that the canned fruits, meats, and vegetables from\n",
      "America and England bore on their labels a picture of the article\n",
      "contained in the can?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, I do remember,\" replied the youth. \"After all, there's\n",

      "There are twelve or fifteen squares, or plazas, in the city, the most\n",
      "important being, of course, the central one known as the Plaza Mayor.\n",
      "The cathedral and the _Casa Municipal_, or City Hall, face upon this\n",
      "square, and on one side of it is the oldest house in the city, dating\n",
      "from 1549. The city was founded in 1542 by Don Francisco de Montejo, the\n",
      "son of the Governor of the Province of Yucatan, and bearing exactly the\n",
      "same name. Montejo, junior, was lieutenant-governor and captain-general,\n",
      "and the old house just mentioned, which is one of the sights of Merida,\n",
      "was built by him. The faÃ§ade is ornamented with sculptures, which are\n",
      "said to have been made by Indians after designs supplied by the\n",
      "Spaniards. They represent the conquerors trampling on the bodies of\n",
      "natives, who have been made non-resistant by the removal of their heads.\n",
      "It was probably the idea of Montejo that the sight of these sculptures\n",
      "would deter the Indians from any further resistance to the white men who\n",
      "came from beyond the sea, and brought the Christian religion to replace\n",

      "porticos supported on arches. It has a high tower, from which watchmen\n",
      "are supposed to be constantly on the lookout for fires; though, owing to\n",

      "speaking of the native Indians--wear cotton trousers, or drawers, which\n",
      "are tight at the waist, and descend to the knee or below it. Sometimes\n",
      "they have shirts on their backs and sometimes none; but in the latter\n",
      "case a man is reasonably certain to have one folded away in his hat, to\n",
      "be worn on state occasions or when the rules of society demand. Some of\n",
      "them wear a long shirt and no trousers, and altogether the wardrobe of a\n",
      "native of the lower class is not costly. Frequently we see men with one\n",
      "leg of the trousers rolled up and the other hanging down, and it is a\n",
      "comical sight when a half a dozen thus arrayed are grouped together. A\n",
      "very noticeable feature about the shirt is that it is worn with the\n",

      "in northern countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The dress of the women is a skirt hanging from the waist to the ground,\n",

      "the ground, like a loose wrapper. It is the traditional dress of 300\n",
      "years ago, and the fashion has not changed at all in that time. On\n",
      "Sundays and feast days both sexes are arrayed in spotless white, but on\n",
      "other days their garments are apt to be more or less dingy. Compared to\n",
      "the Mexicans, the Yucateos, as the people of Yucatan are called, are\n",
      "wonderfully cleanly in their dress and ways, and it is as rare to see a\n",
      "dirty Yucateco as it is to see a clean Aztec. The uipil of the women has\n",
      "short sleeves, and is not as high in the neck as the close-fitted dress\n",
      "of New England, but is a modest and neat-looking dress, and the\n",

      "salt, and other things he wanted; to cultivate his land, and follow him\n",
      "to war whenever he chose to go on a campaign. In fact the condition of\n",

      "\"While on the subject of gambling we will mention the popular amusement\n",
      "of _la loteria_, or 'the lottery.'\n",

      "\"Our guide took us into a large hall, which is open to the public, or\n",
      "rather to anybody who can force his way through the dense crowd at the\n",
      "door. All classes seemed to have assembled there; rich and poor were\n",
      "seated at the same tables, and their object seemed to be amusement\n",
      "rather than gain. The stakes were very small, ordinarily a medio, and in\n",
      "a few instances _dos reales_. The room was hot as an oven, brilliantly\n",
      "lighted, every foot of standing and sitting room was occupied, and white\n",
      "people of all grades in life, gentlemen as well as ladies, negroes,\n",
      "Indians, and mestizos crowded together at the tables, which were in two\n",
      "rows the whole length of the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The amusement is licensed by the Government, which sells sheets of\n",
      "paper for a real each on which the game is played. It is done by a\n",
      "combination of numbers all the way from one to ninety. These numbers are\n",
      "arranged on the paper or cards in different combinations, no two cards\n",
      "being alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Each player buys a card and places it in front of him on the table.\n",
      "Then a hat or a basket is passed around, and each one puts in his medio\n",
      "or whatever else the stake may be. When the money has all been collected\n",
      "and the amount of the stake announced, the game begins. In addition to\n",
      "his card each player has a pile of grains of corn in front of him, and a\n",
      "stick with which to rap on the table when the time to do so arrives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The object is to get a row of five numbers on the cards from the\n",
      "numbers which are drawn, and the one who first gets a row wins the\n",
      "purse. On a platform, in full view of everybody, is a man with a bag\n",
      "containing wooden or ivory balls, on which the numbers from one to\n",
      "ninety are painted. When the game is to begin, this man draws a ball\n",
      "from the bag and announces the number upon it, and the player who finds\n",
      "that number on his card places a grain of corn over the figures. One\n",
      "after another, numbers are called out in a voice that rises above all\n",
      "the confusion of sounds with which the place is filled, and each time a\n",
      "number is called it is marked with the corn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everybody is intently watching his card, and there is a crowd of\n",
      "spectators looking over the shoulders of the players. Men, women,\n",
      "children--white, black, yellow, and all other colors possible to\n",
      "humanity--are there; and so are all the dresses of Yucatan, from the\n",
      "uniform of the high official and the satin or silk of the grand dame of\n",
      "society down to the cotton garb of the Indian, and quite likely his bare\n",
      "shoulders with no garb at all. Three-fourths of those present are\n",
      "smoking, and the atmosphere is like a morning fog, only a great deal\n",
      "worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By-and-by somebody raps sharply on the table with his stick to indicate\n",
      "that he has made a row of five numbers, and stands up in his place. Then\n",
      "the man on the platform calls the drawn numbers again, and if the\n",
      "announcement of the row is correct the winner takes the purse. As the\n",
      "stake is small, he does not win a great deal; but evidently he is the\n",
      "envy of his less fortunate neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mistakes occur sometimes, and then there is a tumult, in which knives\n",
      "may be drawn and things become very lively for the bystanders. We did\n",
      "not stay long in the place, you may be sure, but we came away convinced\n",
      "that la loteria is less ruinous to the pockets of the players than many\n",

      "\"An American gentleman with whom we talked on the subject said that this\n",
      "game is not unlike one known in some other parts of the world under the\n",
      "name of 'keno.' He told us that there were many other forms of gambling\n",
      "in Yucatan, most of them being forbidden by the Government, and\n",
      "consequently played less openly than the lottery. He told us that there\n",
      "was heavy gambling in the clubs; in some of them the play is only for\n",

      "\"The market we have described,\" wrote Fred, \"is for the sale of articles\n",
      "of food only. There is another market where pottery, cotton fabrics, and\n",
      "other miscellaneous wares are sold, and still another which is entirely\n",
      "given up to the makers and venders of hats and hammocks. Hammock-making\n",
      "is a great industry in Yucatan, and thousands of these articles are sent\n",
      "to New York, London, and other foreign ports. A curious circumstance\n",
      "about this industry is that the best hammocks are those for home\n",
      "consumption; the foreign markets are unwilling to pay the prices of the\n",
      "fine qualities, and consequently none are sent away except upon special\n",
      "orders. When you next buy a Yucatan hammock in New York you may make up\n",
      "your mind that it is one in which only a very poor man here would sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: VIEW ON A BACK STREET.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hammocks are in use for sleeping purposes all through this country, and\n",
      "the natives prefer them to beds. Our personal experience is that a\n",
      "hammock is a very good thing to lounge in, or even to take a nap, but\n",
      "for an all-night sleep it doesn't give the rest and refreshment to the\n",
      "tired body that we find in a bed. But habit has a great deal to do with\n",
      "this, as with many other things of life; a Japanese pillow is torture to\n",
      "a European quite as much as the European one is to a Japanese.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The advantages claimed for a hammock are that the sleeper is protected\n",
      "from many insects that would trouble him in a bed, and the opportunity\n",
      "for the air to circulate, which is a very desirable matter in a hot\n",
      "country. Both these arguments are well founded, and so is the further\n",
      "one that the hammock-sleeper can carry his bed with him, as it weighs\n",
      "only a few ounces and can be rolled into a small parcel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We asked the prices and were staggered at the figures. In New York we\n",
      "think $2 a good price, and the majority of the hammocks sold there bring\n",
      "$1 or $1.50 each. The cheapest they showed us was $7, and they had them\n",
      "all the way up to $15, $18, $20, $25, and even $30. The dealer said that\n",
      "if these were not fine enough for our purpose we might have them made to\n",
      "order, and he could give us something superb for $50. We bought some of\n",
      "the cheapest kind, and they were far better than anything we ever saw at\n",
      "home. The best qualities are made of very fine fibre, and if care is\n",
      "taken with them they last for several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While walking along the streets near the market we met some ladies to\n",
      "whom we had been introduced. They recognized and saluted us; they were\n",
      "on the opposite sidewalk, and at first we thought they were beckoning\n",
      "for us to cross over to their side. Then we remembered what we had been\n",
      "told about the Yucateo form of salutation, and replied by raising our\n",
      "hats and bowing. This is what they did:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Each lady raised her hand until it was on a level with her eyes, and\n",
      "then she 'wiggled' her fingers back and forth in a way that is\n",
      "impossible to describe in words. It is very much what one would do in\n",
      "our country if she wished to speak to you, and we can readily believe\n",
      "what we have been told, that this form of salutation is a great puzzle\n",
      "to the stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One day an Englishman, who was thus saluted, went up to his fair\n",
      "recognizer, a lady to whom he had been presented at a party on the\n",
      "previous evening, and stood waiting for her to begin the conversation.\n",
      "She was accompanied by another lady, neither of whom could speak\n",
      "English, while the Englishman did not know a word of any language but\n",
      "his own. The situation was awkward, and after both had pronounced\n",
      "several phrases that the other side could not comprehend, the Englishman\n",
      "bowed and proceeded to walk away. The lady repeated the Merida\n",
      "salutation, and this puzzled the stranger more than ever, as he supposed\n",
      "she wished him to follow. He gallantly complied, and walked demurely\n",
      "along till he happened to meet the gentleman who had introduced him.\n",
      "Explanations followed, and all parties concerned had a good laugh over\n",
      "the occurrence. It is probable that the Englishman's laugh was less\n",
      "hearty than that of the others, as he could not fail to be somewhat\n",
      "mortified at his awkward misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the fashionable hours for strolling on the paseo everybody is there,\n",
      "and no matter how often you meet any one whom you know you are expected\n",
      "to salute. This keeps everybody on the alert, as the turns of the paseo\n",
      "are likely to bring the same individuals face to face every few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: SCENE IN A BALL-ROOM.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was our good-fortune to be in Merida in the season of dancing, and\n",
      "we were invited to go to a ball, in fact to several balls. We went first\n",
      "to an aristocratic one, which was given in the Casino, a large,\n",
      "two-storied building, with balconies or verandas all around, and\n",
      "brilliantly lighted. It is built around a court-yard planted with\n",
      "tropical trees and flowers in great profusion, and is a very attractive\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The ball-room occupied three sides of the upper story of the building,\n",
      "while the fourth contained the dressing and supper rooms. The orchestra\n",
      "was in the corridor just outside the dancing-hall, and while everybody\n",
      "could hear the music, very few could see the musicians. We got there\n",
      "before the dance began and while the ladies were coming out of the\n",
      "dressing-rooms and taking seats at the side of the ball-room, very much\n",
      "as they are seated in other countries. We observed that the gentlemen\n",
      "held the ladies by the hand as they escorted them to their seats, and\n",
      "not by giving them their arms as we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a real beauty show when the ladies were ranged along the wall,\n",
      "and they seemed to know it just as well as did their admirers, who\n",
      "congregated at one end of the hall and in the corridors, and smoked\n",
      "cigarettes. The gentlemen chatted with each other with more or less\n",
      "animation, but watched the line of seÃ±oritas, whose eyes sparkled like\n",
      "diamonds and were a sharp contrast to their pearly white teeth. Under\n",
      "the light the seÃ±oritas' complexions were as glowing as that of a young\n",
      "English girl; of course, we cannot say how much of it is due to nature,\n",
      "and how much to cosmetics. They all had splendid heads of coal-black\n",
      "hair, arranged in the tasteful way for which Spanish ladies are famous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The music struck up for a waltz, and then each gentleman advanced\n",
      "towards the lady of his choice, and whirled her away for the round of\n",
      "the hall. The theory of these balls is that everybody knows everybody\n",
      "else, and the gentlemen did not ask the ladies whether they wanted to\n",
      "dance or not. Of course, it is to be presumed that they were there with\n",
      "that object in view, but we thought it would be more graceful if they\n",
      "had been consulted before being lifted from their seats and set in\n",
      "motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had wondered how it was possible for people to dance in this hot\n",
      "atmosphere, but when we heard how slowly the music played, and saw that\n",
      "the waltz was only a slow gliding and sliding over the floor, as though\n",
      "the waltzers were not more than half awake, we wondered no longer. It is\n",
      "nothing like the exciting whirl of a waltz in northern countries; and\n",
      "the same may be said of the other dances of this very select assemblage.\n",
      "We remained half an hour or so, and then went to the mestizo ball, where\n",
      "it was a good deal more animated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The mestizo girls wore the white dresses already described; some of\n",
      "them had only a few ribbons or flowers for ornaments, while others were\n",
      "loaded down with bracelets, rings, and other ornaments, in which\n",
      "diamonds had a more or less prominent part. A gentleman who was with us\n",
      "said many of the diamonds were hired for the occasion, and he had no\n",
      "doubt that a good share of them were paste. The men were the most\n",
      "comical sights you can imagine, as they all wore their hats, and the\n",
      "most of them had their shirts waving outside, after the custom of the\n",
      "country. Some of them had coats and jackets. A man thus clad was looked\n",
      "upon as an aristocrat; but to be so considered he was obliged to suffer\n",
      "some inconvenience, as the outer garment is a serious burden in the\n",
      "heavy tropical atmosphere, made doubly oppressive by the heat of the\n",
      "room. Two or three men carried their jackets on their arms, and some\n",
      "flung them into a corner at the risk of never finding them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The musicians were native Indians, who played with perfect time and\n",
      "melody, as though they had graduated from the schools of the most\n",
      "accomplished masters of Europe. All these people are natural musicians;\n",
      "a very little instruction suffices for them, and with careful training\n",
      "they ought to be able to astonish the world. The men and women dance to\n",
      "perfection; we did not see a false step taken during the time we looked\n",
      "on at the ball, and yet it is not likely that any of the dancers ever\n",
      "had the advantage of a professional instructor. The members of the\n",
      "orchestra at the mestizo ball were dressed in the shirt and drawers\n",
      "already mentioned, and, like the dancing men of the party, retained\n",
      "their hats all the time they played.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The dances were more interesting than those of the fashionable ball,\n",
      "inasmuch as the latter were European in character, while those of the\n",
      "mestizos had a peculiarity of their own. One was called the zopilote, or\n",
      "buzzard dance; a man and a woman each carrying a handkerchief which they\n",
      "twirled above their heads, and in all sorts of directions whirled and\n",
      "twisted themselves along the floor, all the while keeping perfect time\n",
      "to the music of the performers. It reminded us very much of one of the\n",
      "national dances of the Russians, which is often given by the ballet\n",
      "troupes of the imperial theatres of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and may\n",
      "be seen in its simplicity in almost any town or village of the great\n",

      "[Illustration: INDIANS DANCING.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But more interesting to us than either of the balls we have mentioned\n",
      "was that of the Indians, where they were indulging in historic dances\n",
      "which have been preserved from ancient times. When we entered the room,\n",
      "which was pretty well filled with people who respectfully made way for\n",
      "us, the performance had already begun. We will remark here that the\n",
      "ancient Yucateos, like the Parsees, were worshippers of the sun; the\n",
      "reverence for that luminary has descended to this day, though it is by\n",
      "no means preserved in its former purity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Ober, the author of 'Travels in Mexico,' seems to have witnessed a\n",
      "better performance of this dance than we did, as he saw the beginning,\n",
      "which we did not see, so we will quote his account, which is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'The first thing these Indians did was to spread a banner in the centre\n",
      "of the room, on which was painted a figure of the sun, with two people\n",
      "kneeling in adoration of it. The chief of this band of about twenty\n",
      "Indians then suspended from his neck a bright-colored representation of\n",
      "the sun stamped on tin. At the foot of the banner-staff crouched an old\n",
      "man, with a drum made by stretching the skin of a calf or goat over one\n",
      "end of a hollow log; at the side of the drum hung the shell of a\n",
      "land-tortoise, and the old man beat the drum and rattled the shell in\n",
      "unison. The article with which he beat the drum attracted my attention,\n",
      "and I examined it and found it to be the gilded horn of a deer. This\n",
      "hollow drum, with turtle-shell and deer's antler, fully confirms the\n",
      "statement that the music is aboriginal; for one of the old chroniclers,\n",
      "in an account of a terrible battle with the Indians of Campeachy,\n",
      "writing not long after the event, says that they made a most horrible\n",
      "and deafening noise with these instruments: \"They had flutes and large\n",
      "sea-shells for trumpets, and turtle-shells, which they struck with\n",
      "deer's horns.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: PREPARING FOR THE BALL.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'After the banner was spread, the band ran around it in a crouching\n",
      "attitude; in one hand each held a rattle, and in the other a fan of\n",
      "turkey feathers, with a handle formed by the foot and claw of the bird.\n",
      "Each one wore a wire mask, with a handkerchief over his head, and a\n",
      "mantle embroidered with figures of animals, and hung with small\n",
      "sea-shells. The costume was that of the mestizo women--a skirt from the\n",
      "waist to the ankles, with their peculiar dress over it--just such an one\n",
      "as was worn by their ancestors centuries ago, and by the ancient\n",
      "Egyptians. On their feet they wore sandals, tied on with hempen rope.\n",
      "The chief was distinguished by a high crown of peacock feathers. He\n",
      "chanted something in the Maya language, and they replied, and then the\n",
      "music struck up a weird strain and they danced furiously, assuming\n",
      "ludicrous postures, yet all having seeming significance, shaking their\n",
      "rattles and fans to right and left, and all keeping perfect time. After\n",
      "nearly half an hour of dancing they stopped at a signal from the chief,\n",
      "and gathered about the banner, gazing upon the image of the sun with\n",

      "As our friends went to the door they met their host, who had just\n",

      "wondered if all four of them, the host and his three guests, were to\n",
      "ride in one cochÃ©, and while the wonderment continued another vehicle of\n",
      "the same kind came dashing around the corner.\n",

      "Their entertainer, Mr. Honradez, suggested that Doctor Bronson and\n",
      "himself would ride in one carriage, while the two youths occupied the\n",
      "other. As they were to spend a night at the hacienda, each of the\n",
      "travellers carried a small hand-bag, and these articles, added to some\n",
      "cushions which Mr. Honradez had thoughtfully placed in the seatless\n",
      "vehicles, added considerably to the comfort of the ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Away they dashed along the rough streets of Merida and out through the\n",
      "thickly shaded suburbs. They met dozens of natives bringing into the\n",
      "city loads of country produce to sell in the market-place; the bearers\n",
      "bent beneath their burdens, and many of them had travelled all night in\n",
      "order to reach the city in the morning. The most conspicuous of these\n",
      "porters were the sellers of _ramon_, the branches of a tree that serve\n",
      "as food for horses and mules, which eat the leaves and twigs of ramon as\n",
      "they do grass or hay. According to its bulk, the stuff is very light,\n",
      "and a ramon-seller is completely hidden beneath his apparently enormous\n",
      "but really comfortable load.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Honradez made things interesting,\" said Fred, \"by getting up a race\n",
      "between our two carriages. He promised two reals to the driver who would\n",
      "get first to a village which he named, and the fellows went at it in\n",
      "earnest. They stood up on the shafts of their vehicles and yelled at\n",
      "their mules; at the same time they were not sparing of their whips, and\n",
      "the result was that the poor beasts went at a furious gallop for a mile\n",
      "or more. Our driver got in advance, and as we saw that the race would be\n",
      "kept up as long as the teams could run, Frank and I suggested to him\n",
      "that we would give him three reals to let the other man win. He\n",
      "immediately accepted the offer and dropped to the rear, shouting\n",
      "something in Maya to his competitor as the latter passed him. After that\n",
      "we went on at a more respectable pace, and were heartily glad that the\n",
      "breakneck speed was not kept up.\n",

      "by the processes of half a century ago. The real profit of the hacienda\n",
      "is in the production of fibre, and in this the latest machinery is in\n",
      "use. The old process of making fibre by hand is altogether discarded as\n",
      "unprofitable, and the stripping of the leaves of the henequin is\n",

      "private owner, who is generally the descendant of somebody who obtained\n",
      "an immense grant in consequence of some real or fancied service to the\n",

      "already that the plants are in condition for cutting when they are five\n",
      "years old, and will yield leaves annually for fifteen or twenty years. A\n",
      "good planter will so arrange it that new plants are constantly coming to\n",

      "whole of it is exported. Four-fifths of our product is sent to the\n",
      "United States, where it is used for cordage, bagging, and many other\n",
      "things of the same sort, and most of the rest to Europe. There are two\n",
      "or three small factories here in Yucatan for making coarse cloth, ropes,\n",

      "woven. These factories purchase their fibre from the haciendas, but\n",
      "their consumption is small. The Indians use a great deal of fibre in\n",
      "making articles for their personal needs, but they generally scrape it\n",

      "\"Would you like to see a _cenotÃ©_?\" said Mr. Honradez, just before our\n",
      "friends retired for the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" replied Doctor Bronson for himself and the youths, while\n",
      "the latter wondered what a cenotÃ© was.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: A CORNER OF THE HACIENDA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll show you one in the morning,\" was the reply. Then there was\n",
      "an exchange of wishes all around for a pleasant slumber, and in a little\n",
      "while everybody was in bed, or rather in hammock. Our friends had\n",
      "brought their hammocks as part of their baggage, and when they were\n",
      "ready to retire they found those useful articles stretched in the\n",
      "corridor of the principal dwelling of the hacienda, in a place that\n",
      "afforded ample ventilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it was owing to the expected cenotÃ© or the unrestful character\n",
      "of a night's novitiate in a hammock we are unable to say, but the youths\n",
      "were up somewhat earlier than usual and eager to begin the day. Doctor\n",
      "Bronson was not far behind them, and they did not have to wait long for\n",
      "their host. When he appeared he was followed by a mozo carrying an\n",
      "armful of towels, and after a hearty greeting led the way to a small\n",
      "house at a little distance from the stables of the hacienda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred suggested to his cousin, while their host was in conversation with\n",
      "Doctor Bronson, that the cenotÃ© was probably some kind of game, and they\n",
      "would quite likely have it for breakfast. \"Perhaps,\" said he, \"they keep\n",
      "it alive and kill it when wanted, and this house may be the place where\n",
      "it is shut up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it's something to wear,\" replied Frank, \"and the house is the\n",
      "store-room. Possibly, though, it's some kind of vegetable like celery or\n",
      "onions. Anyway, we'll find out soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were speedily enlightened on the subject. On reaching the house in\n",
      "question, Mr. Honradez explained that it was the entrance to a private\n",
      "cenotÃ© of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are already aware,\" said he, \"that there are no rivers in Yucatan,\n",
      "and have learned from experience that we have plenty of water,\n",
      "notwithstanding the absence of streams. Beneath the calcareous formation\n",
      "on which the whole of the peninsula stands there are streams and lakes\n",
      "of water, which are reached through natural or artificial openings in\n",
      "the surface rock. These openings, whether natural or artificial, are\n",
      "called cenotÃ©s, and some of them are of great depth. Sometimes they are\n",
      "mere pits or wells, and, on the other hand, there are cenotÃ©s which form\n",
      "large grottos with lakes of considerable area. The water is clear and\n",
      "cool and entirely wholesome. We use the cenotÃ©s for obtaining our supply\n",
      "of water and also for bathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is our bathing-house,\" he continued, \"and I've brought you here\n",
      "for your morning bath. You will find bathing-trousers in the rooms, and\n",
      "can undress and come down as soon as you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He showed them the way into their dressing-rooms, and then disappeared\n",
      "into a room of his own. When the youths reappeared, in appropriate\n",
      "costume, their host called to them from somewhere down in the interior\n",
      "of the earth, and they proceeded in the direction of the voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: AN UNDERGROUND WALK.]\n",
      "\n",
      "By a sloping and slippery stair-way cut in the rock they descended some\n",
      "thirty-five or forty feet till they reached a pool of clear water over\n",
      "which the rock rounded in a high dome nearly to the surface. A hole two\n",
      "or three feet in diameter and covered with an iron grating opened in the\n",
      "centre of the dome, and gave light enough to show the interior of the\n",
      "place very fairly. Many stalactites hung from the roof, and stalagmites\n",
      "stood up wherever they could find standing room. From the grotto where\n",
      "our friends found themselves little nooks and small grottos opened, so\n",
      "that the spot was by no means unattractive. Numerous lizards clung to\n",
      "the rock or swam in the water; and these crawling and slimy things took\n",
      "away many of the merits the bathing-place might have possessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FORMATION OF STALACTITES.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The lizards do no harm,\" said Mr. Honradez, \"but they are not pleasant\n",
      "to look at, and we would gladly drive them out if we could. There is a\n",
      "curious bird called the 'toh' which lives in the cenotÃ©s; it has a soft\n",
      "plumage, and sports a long tail of only two feathers, which have nothing\n",
      "on their stems until the very tip is reached. If you look sharp you may\n",
      "possibly see an eyeless fish similar to the fishes which are found in\n",
      "the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The youths looked in every direction, and though Frank thought he saw\n",
      "one of these strange members of the finny tribe he was unable to capture\n",
      "it. Frank asked if the cenotÃ©s communicated with each other or were\n",
      "separately supplied from the rains sinking into the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We cannot say that all of them are connected,\" was the reply; \"but it\n",
      "is certain that some of them are. Many contain streams with perceptible\n",
      "currents, and it has been observed that at times the cenotÃ©s are full of\n",
      "alligators, while at others none can be found there. As the alligator\n",
      "cannot pierce its way through solid rock, there must be channels which\n",
      "connect with large bodies of water where the alligators live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the suggestion of alligators Frank and Fred intimated that they did\n",
      "not care to stay long in the water, and their search for eyeless fish\n",
      "was abandoned in favor of the larger game. Mr. Honradez laughed, and\n",
      "said there was not the slightest danger, as no alligator larger than a\n",
      "rat could possibly make its way into the place where they were, as all\n",
      "the entrance channels were very small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus reassured, they remained tranquil, and enjoyed the plunge and swim\n",
      "in the cool water. Meanwhile their host explained that these sources of\n",
      "water supply had been known from very ancient times; long before the\n",
      "Conquest the inhabitants built their towns near the water-holes, and at\n",
      "the present time any one desiring to establish a hacienda seeks first a\n",
      "good cenotÃ©, and locates his buildings near it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On returning from the bath the host showed them the well which supplied\n",
      "the hacienda with water. Peons drew the water in buckets at the end of a\n",
      "long rope passing over a windlass, and poured it into a large trough,\n",
      "whence it was taken by the servants from the kitchen, or allowed to flow\n",
      "in pipes to the engine-house, stables, or wherever else it was needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: AT A NORIA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In nearly every village throughout Yucatan,\" said Mr. Honradez, \"you\n",
      "will find a well of this sort in the public square; it is called a\n",
      "_noria_, and the usual mode of drawing water is by an endless rope\n",
      "passing over a wheel and carrying small buckets. These bring up the\n",
      "water from below, and as they turn over the wheel they pour their\n",
      "contents into a trough. The system is almost an exact copy of that in\n",
      "use in Egypt centuries before Yucatan was heard of. The rude machine is\n",
      "propelled by a mule walking in a circle and driven by a boy. The mule is\n",
      "invariably an old one, fit for no other work, and sometimes a horse or\n",
      "ox, likewise old and poor, is found in its place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose the village pays for the mule and the driver,\" one of the\n",
      "youths remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" was the reply; \"and the payment is by direct taxation. Every\n",
      "person who takes a jar of water is expected to leave a handful of corn\n",
      "in payment. This corn goes for the support of the boy and the animal,\n",
      "and to judge by the condition of the beast, the lion's share of the tax\n",
      "is taken by the boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation about the curious wells of Yucatan came to an end with\n",
      "several stories concerning them. One was that in the town of Tabi there\n",
      "is a large cenotÃ© which shows down in the depths of the water when the\n",
      "sun is at the meridian the perfect figure of a palm-tree, trunk, leaves,\n",
      "and all being fully delineated. In another town there is a cenotÃ© where,\n",
      "according to the early chroniclers, any one dies instantly who enters\n",
      "the water without holding his breath. It is needless to say that bathing\n",
      "there is not at all popular. Other subterranean pools contain poisonous\n",
      "lizards which cause violent and even fatal headaches by merely biting\n",
      "the shadow of any person who passes them. Another lizard, when wounded,\n",
      "is said to throw its tail at its assailant; it detaches and throws it a\n",
      "distance of several yards, and if it strikes the flesh will cause death.\n",
      "Many of the cenotÃ©s are reputed to be the haunts of demons and fairies,\n",
      "the bad spirits being much more numerous than the good ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the cool hours of the afternoon our friends started on their return\n",
      "to Merida, and late in the evening drew up in front of the hotel. Their\n",
      "host urged them to remain a week or two at the hacienda; with the\n",
      "politeness customary to the country, he told them that the place and\n",
      "everything about it were theirs--a declaration which was certainly in\n",
      "earnest, so far as a prolonged visit was concerned. But they were\n",
      "anxious to continue their investigations of Yucatan, and having already\n",
      "arranged to go to Uxmal with an American gentleman residing at Merida,\n",
      "were unable to remain longer with Mr. Honradez.\n",

      "The second morning after their return they started for the ruins of\n",

      "to go with them to see a _heetzmek_.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: SCENE OF THE HEETZMEK.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Wondering what a heetzmek was, they followed to a house a few yards\n",
      "away, where a woman was walking around the dwelling carrying a very\n",
      "young child astride her hip. Having completed the circuit, she repeated\n",
      "it again and again, till she had walked five times around the dwelling,\n",
      "carrying the child as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a ceremony which corresponds to the christening of infants in\n",
      "other countries,\" said the gentleman. \"The woman that you see is the\n",
      "baby's godmother; the position in which the Yucateos carry their\n",
      "children astride the hip is like that of India and some other Asiatic\n",
      "countries. The heetzmek is performed when the infant is about four\n",
      "months old.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The natives believe in the magic of the number five. You have seen the\n",
      "woman walk five times around the house as she carries the child. Five\n",
      "eggs have been buried in hot ashes, and as they break they will rouse\n",
      "the five senses of the infant; if they fail to open, it will be of only\n",
      "ordinary intelligence, but their breaking will insure extraordinary\n",
      "mental ability.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably,\" remarked Frank, \"they take good care to have the ashes hot\n",
      "enough to make sure that the eggs will burst.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they are as intelligent as they want the child to be, they certainly\n",
      "will,\" replied Mr. Burbank. \"In addition to the egg test there is a\n",
      "further ceremony of putting into the infant's hands the implements it\n",
      "will use when matured. The godmother is held in great respect by the\n",
      "whole family, and especially by the child for whom she has stood\n",
      "sponsor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The heetzmek over, the journey was continued, the mules having rested\n",
      "sufficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nine o'clock in the forenoon, and about twenty-five miles of the\n",
      "journey had been made when the walls of the hacienda of UayalkÃ© came in\n",
      "sight. The appetites of the youths were on a keen edge, and Frank\n",
      "remarked to Fred that he could breakfast off the hind-leg of a donkey,\n",
      "if only that ordinarily unattractive viand were presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I scent breakfast,\" responded Fred. \"They are famed for their\n",
      "hospitality in Yucatan, and we'll probably find what we want at this\n",
      "hacienda.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His prediction was verified, for hardly had he ceased speaking when the\n",
      "foremost carriage turned towards the yard of the hacienda, followed very\n",
      "naturally by the other. The drivers unhitched their mules beneath a\n",
      "wide-spreading tree in front of the residence of the manager, and\n",
      "proceeded to make themselves at home. The _mayordomo_ came out and\n",
      "welcomed the strangers, and without waiting for a suggestion from Mr.\n",
      "Burbank, whom he knew, he sent a servant to order breakfast. In a very\n",
      "short time it was ready, and the travellers sat down; tortillas,\n",
      "frijoles, stewed chicken, eggs, and fruit, disappeared in due course,\n",
      "and the keen appetites were keen no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How about the posterior limb of the _equus asinus_ now?\" whispered Fred\n",
      "to Frank, as they left the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Non possumus_,\" was the only answer that occurred to Frank. His views\n",
      "on the subject of edible things had materially changed in the last hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youths made note of the fact that the hacienda of UayalkÃ© was a\n",
      "large and evidently a very prosperous one. The manager told them that\n",
      "they had several thousand acres of land in henequin, and there were more\n",
      "than 1200 men and women employed about the establishment and in the\n",
      "fields. The engines and machinery were more ponderous and powerful than\n",
      "at the hacienda already described; and the buildings of the\n",
      "establishment, together with the huts of the laborers, formed quite a\n",
      "settlement. There was a deep cenotÃ©, from which a troop of women were\n",
      "drawing water, by means of a wheel, with buckets on an endless rope; as\n",
      "fast as their jars were filled they carried them away in the direction\n",
      "of the garden, where the water was used for keeping bright the orange\n",
      "and other trees that cannot live without water.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: GARDEN OF THE HACIENDA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The garden, thus invigorated, was like a spot of green in a desert, and\n",
      "reminded the youths of some of the oases they had visited in their\n",
      "Oriental journeyings. Frank compared it to Biskra, in the Great Sahara,\n",
      "and Fred declared that he saw a striking resemblance to some of the\n",
      "gardens at the edge of the Libyan Desert. Beyond the garden in every\n",
      "direction was the dry and repellent land covered with the hardy\n",
      "henequin, which needs no water, or but the merest trifle of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not see an idler about the place, every one from the manager\n",
      "down seeming to be fully occupied. Mr. Burbank said that no hacienda in\n",
      "the whole country was better managed than this, and there was none where\n",
      "the laborers were better satisfied with their employer and employment.\n",
      "He added that here, as everywhere else in Yucatan, the laborers were\n",
      "constantly in debt to the establishment, and therefore were unable to\n",
      "quit work suddenly or \"go on strike.\" A laborer who is in debt cannot\n",
      "change employers, unless the new one assumes the responsibility of the\n",
      "obligation to the old; and to bring this about requires considerable\n",
      "negotiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a stay of two hours and more at the hacienda, the journey was\n",
      "continued. Six or seven miles farther on the travellers reached the\n",
      "cenotÃ© of MucuychÃ©, and made a brief halt to examine it. The cavern is\n",
      "about forty feet deep, and the entrance is surrounded by a garden kept\n",
      "green by the water drawn from the never-failing source. Our friends\n",
      "descended by means of steps cut in the rock. These steps were overhung\n",
      "by stalactites, which furnished convenient holding-ground for nests of\n",
      "swallows and hornets in great numbers. What particularly pleased the\n",
      "youths was that they found here an abundance of the blind fishes that\n",
      "they sought in vain in their first exploration of underground Yucatan.\n",
      "There was the same abundance and variety of lizards and other creeping\n",
      "things as before; some of them were of goodly size, and Fred learned\n",
      "that they were iguanas, and that they often appeared at table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you drive them away as soon as possible,\" he replied. \"They\n",
      "are not pleasant things to look at when one is eating.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary,\" Mr. Burbank answered, \"the iguana is a delicacy of\n",
      "which I have often partaken. He appears at table, not in his live state,\n",
      "but after passing through the hands of the cook.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: NATIVE VILLAGE NEAR UXMAL.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred thought he did not want any iguana then or at any other time, and\n",
      "his mind was firmly made up on the subject. His views changed two or\n",
      "three days later when, after eating heartily of a delicious stew, which\n",
      "secured the praises of both Frank and himself, he learned that the stew\n",
      "aforesaid was nothing less than the despised iguana. He quietly remarked\n",
      "that great allowance must be made for prejudice, and then dismissed the\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two hours before sunset they reached a hacienda, where they received\n",
      "the same cordial reception as at UayalkÃ©. It had been intended to\n",
      "complete the journey to Uxmal that day, but as the hour was late and\n",
      "darkness would certainly overtake them before their destination could be\n",
      "reached, Mr. Burbank decided to accept the pressing invitation of the\n",

      "The mules were unharnessed and led away to the stables, where they were\n",
      "bountifully fed on fresh grass cut and brought by the peons. There was a\n",
      "fine garden here filled with all sorts of tropical trees; and not the\n",
      "least interesting sight in the place was a large number of beehives of a\n",
      "very primitive character. They were nothing else than sections of a\n",
      "hollow log cut off with a saw, and the ends closed with dried mud, or\n",
      "with boards fitted in, like the head of a barrel.\n",

      "Frank and Fred stood at a respectful distance as they looked at the\n",
      "beehives. They were mindful of the proverb which refers to the prudence\n",
      "of the burnt child; and having been stung by the honey insects on\n",
      "several occasions, they did not wish a repetition of the experience. Mr.\n",
      "Burbank walked fearlessly up to the hives and called to the youths to\n",
      "follow him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please excuse us,\" replied Frank; \"the bees may recognize you, as\n",
      "you've been here before, but they don't know us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind _them_,\" the gentleman answered, with a laugh. \"The bees in\n",
      "this country are stingless, and you run no risk in making their\n",
      "acquaintance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus assured, the youths advanced and found themselves unharmed. The\n",
      "bees circled about them in great numbers, but \"left no sting behind.\"\n",
      "Mr. Burbank told them that the hives were emptied every six or eight\n",
      "weeks, and thus the bees were kept busy the year round. Why they collect\n",
      "honey in a country where flowers are perpetually in bloom he could not\n",
      "understand. \"It speaks well for the industry of the insect,\" he\n",
      "remarked; \"he has no occasion to work, and only does so from the force\n",
      "of ancestral habit. He has some imitators among the human race, but by\n",
      "no means so generally as many of us might wish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While discussing the subject of bee-keeping in Yucatan they were called\n",
      "to supper, which was an excellent one, of purely Mexican character.\n",
      "Turtle soup, chile con carne, frijoles, tortillas, and other national\n",
      "dishes were served in abundance, and the meal ended with honey from the\n",
      "beehives which they had investigated. Frank and Fred had observed a\n",
      "delicious fragrance as they entered the room where supper was served,\n",
      "and were unable at first to discover its origin. All the scent of the\n",
      "finest flowers of Yucatan seemed to be gathered there. They looked\n",
      "around for floral baskets or bouquets, but none were visible. When the\n",
      "honey was served they found that this it was which furnished the\n",
      "fragrance, and they asked Mr. Burbank about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite right,\" he answered; \"it is the perfume of the honey that\n",
      "fills your nostrils. In some seasons of the year it is much greater than\n",
      "now; it spreads over the whole house, and is as powerful as musk or any\n",

      "service was ended each of the worshippers said \"_Buenos noches, seÃ±or_\"\n",
      "(good-night, sir) to each of the strangers. Everybody went early to bed,\n",

      "born to her, and he became a great favorite, for he was good and clever,\n",
      "though very small--in fact, a dwarf. Finally he became so\n",
      "popular--probably the people fawned on him to please the formidable\n",
      "witch--that the King grew jealous, and sought his destruction by giving\n",

      "disobedience. But, thanks to his mother, the boy always succeeded.\n",
      "\n",

      "shall surely die, for the King has ordered me to do more than I can\n",

      "\"'\"Never mind, my child, don't be alarmed. In the morning the house will\n",
      "be there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'It was, and from that day to this has been called the Dwarf's House.\n",
      "The King was enraged. He sent for the dwarf. \"I am greatly pleased with\n",
      "the house. Now I want to break six cocoyoles\" (small and _very_ hard\n",
      "cocoanuts about the size of a walnut) \"on your head, and then I will\n",

      "the snake basking in the sun; one threw his poncho over the reptile\n",
      "while the other held its head to the ground with a forked stick till its\n",
      "mouth could be sewed up, so that it could do no harm. The snake was\n",
      "about three feet long. The ceremony took place in the evening, and the\n",

      "have not remained so for any length of time. Several attempts at a\n",
      "federation (one of them in 1888), have resulted in nothing. Now and then\n",

      "established in 1871. Substantially it was as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Congress of Costa Rica had caused a railway to be surveyed from\n",
      "ocean to ocean across the State. It was necessary to seek foreign aid\n",
      "for the construction of the line, and the two banking houses at San\n",
      "JosÃ©, the capital city, were rivals for the appointment of Government\n",

      "\n",
      "The defeated banker was, like his rival, an Englishman (married to a\n",
      "Costa Rican lady), and the capital of his bank was English. In revenge,\n",
      "and with a view to business, he determined to overthrow the Government\n",
      "and set up one of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end he negotiated with a cowboy named Thomas Guardia, who had\n",
      "made a reputation as commander of a small force of cavalry in a war with\n",
      "Nicaragua, to head a revolution, under promise of money and position.\n",
      "The army of the republic comprised about 250 men, and they were easily\n",
      "overcome by Guardia, who assembled half that number of cowboys and rode\n",
      "suddenly into San JosÃ© one morning, capturing the whole place by\n",
      "surprise. It was one of the \"revolutions before breakfast,\" to which\n",
      "Central America is accustomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: BANANA PLANTATION IN COSTA RICA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardia imprisoned all the Government officials who did not run away,\n",
      "and appointed himself Dictator. Among the fugitives was the\n",
      "constitutional President, and therefore it was necessary to hold an\n",
      "election for a new President, Guardia being made provisional President\n",
      "until the election could be held. The English banker, who had started\n",
      "the revolution, named his father-in-law as the candidate for President,\n",
      "and it was expected that he would be elected without opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardia concluded, from his experience as Dictator, that it was not a\n",

      "father-in-law out in the cold. He was unanimously elected; 2000 votes\n",
      "were cast in a population of 200,000, and Guardia received them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was unable to read or write when he became President, but he was a\n",
      "man of decided ability, called wise counsellors to aid him, did\n",
      "everything he could for the advancement of his country, and altogether\n",

      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: GEN. LUIS BOGRAN, PRESIDENT OF HONDURAS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I found Honduras very interesting,\" said Mr. Wilson, \"and was sorry\n",
      "that I could not remain longer. The country seems to have great promise,\n",
      "as it is exceedingly fertile, and the mountain regions contain great\n",
      "quantities of gold and silver. All tropical fruits grow there in\n",
      "abundance, and there might be a large product of coffee and sugar. At\n",
      "present the exports consist chiefly of cattle, mahogany, hides, and\n",
      "rubber, of a total value of about two millions of dollars annually, and\n",
      "the imports are nearly as much. The expenses of conducting the\n",
      "government are not far from one million dollars a year, sometimes\n",
      "exceeding the revenue, and sometimes falling below it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Honduras has been unfortunate financially,\" continued the gentleman,\n",
      "\"as it contracted a loan in England for building a railway across the\n",
      "country from ocean to ocean, and the greater part of the money went into\n",
      "private hands and not in the most honest way imaginable. Twenty-seven\n",
      "million dollars' worth of bonds were negotiated in London, under the\n",
      "guarantee of the Government, and all that the country has to show for\n",
      "this large amount of money is about sixty miles of poorly built railway.\n",
      "Since 1872 the interest on this loan has not been paid, and probably it\n",
      "never will be; in the negotiations the Government and the purchasers of\n",
      "the bonds were deceived, and the country never obtained more than a\n",
      "small fraction of the benefit that was promised.\n",

      "bonds for a part of it, and creating a new loan by which the\n",
      "Interoceanic Railway can be completed and other railways constructed.\n",
      "The President of Honduras, General Bogran, is a man of great enterprise,\n",
      "and has done much for the country since he took possession of his\n",
      "office. His predecessor had built a fine boulevard from the capital part\n",
      "way to the Pacific coast, but from that point there was only a\n",
      "mule-track, the same that had been there for three hundred years.\n",
      "General Bogran made a contract with some American engineers to build a\n",
      "wagon-road from the coast to the end of this boulevard, and another from\n",
      "the capital, Tegucigalpa, to Yuscaran, the centre of the principal\n",
      "mining district.\"\n",

      "paused for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, I'll do so with great pleasure,\" was the reply. \"Honduras\n",
      "was the first part of the main-land of North America visited by Columbus\n",
      "and his companions, and as soon as Cortez had completed the conquest of\n",
      "Mexico and established himself firmly on its soil he proceeded to the\n",
      "subjugation of Honduras. From the time of the Conquest down to 1820 the\n",
      "mines of Honduras yielded enormously of gold and silver; the Government\n",
      "took as its share twenty per cent. of the gross product, and whenever a\n",
      "district proved to be unusually rich the King acknowledged the\n",
      "good-fortune by 'decorating' the place. This was a much more economical\n",
      "proceeding than reducing the taxes or granting a sum in money for public\n",
      "improvements.\n",
      "\n",

      "puzzled expression on the faces of the youths. \"When I was at\n",
      "Tegucigalpa I examined some old documents in the Government library, and\n",
      "came upon one containing the following paragraph:\n",

      "\"A decree of that sort is exactly like conferring a decoration on an\n",

      "\"To show you how rich were the mines of Honduras, let me instance the\n",
      "Guayabilla mine in the Yuscaran district. It is about fifty miles east\n",
      "of Tegucigalpa, and near the line of Nicaragua, at an elevation of 3250\n",
      "feet above the sea-level. In the old days the ore was so rich that the\n",
      "owners of the mine did not reduce any that yielded less than sixty\n",
      "dollars per ton, and after the mine was deserted $60,000 was obtained\n",
      "from it by a gentleman who now lives in the country. From 1812 to 1817\n",
      "the King's fifths from this mine amounted to $400,000, so that in five\n",
      "years the product of the mine was $2,000,000. In 1837 the mine had been\n",
      "worked to a depth of 300 feet, when the miners were impeded by water.\n",
      "Accordingly they prepared to abandon the mine, and did so by removing\n",
      "the pillars for the sake of the ore they contained. Of course the mine\n",
      "caved in soon after the pillars were removed, and the same was the case\n",
      "with other mines that were similarly maltreated.\"\n",

      "Fred asked Mr. Wilson how many productive mines there were in Honduras\n",
      "during the time of its occupation by the Spaniards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As to that I cannot say exactly,\" was the reply, \"but at a rough\n",
      "calculation there were not fewer than fifty in the Yuscaran district\n",
      "that were once active and paid royalties to the King. In the Choluteca\n",
      "and Tegucigalpa districts there were fully 100 mines, so that we may\n",
      "safely count 150 in all. Under the enlightened policy of President\n",

      "for getting rid of superfluous water and foul air. Modern pumping and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Careful scientific surveys have been made of the Nicaragua route. The\n",

      "\n",
      "For further information Doctor Bronson referred the youths to the\n",

      "possession, and also to articles in _Harper's Weekly_ and _Harper's\n",
      "Magazine_. Frank and Fred made a careful study of the subject, and the\n",
      "substance of what they learned may be set down as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "The route of the proposed canal will be entirely through the State of\n",
      "Nicaragua, except for a small part of the eastern division, where it\n",
      "will be on the south bank of the San Juan River, which is the dividing\n",
      "line between Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The latter State has agreed to\n",
      "all the conditions named by Nicaragua in its concession to the American\n",
      "company that is undertaking the work, so that the question of boundary\n",
      "will not interfere with the enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "In March, 1887, a contract was signed with the Republic of Nicaragua by\n",
      "a representative of the Nicaragua Canal Association of New York,\n",
      "securing to the association the exclusive right of way for the\n",
      "construction of a ship-canal between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n",
      "The company is allowed two and a half years from the date of the\n",
      "contract for beginning operations; it has a grant of 1,000,000 acres of\n",
      "land, and immunity from taxation and all imposts of every kind for a\n",
      "period of ninety-nine years. It is believed that the entire work will be\n",
      "completed and the canal made ready for the passage of ships within six\n",
      "years from the commencement of the dredging and digging.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: VIEW ON LAKE NICARAGUA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The length of the canal will be 170 miles from ocean to ocean. Of this\n",
      "distance there will be 130 miles of navigation on Lake Nicaragua and the\n",
      "San Juan River, leaving only forty miles for excavation or cutting. The\n",
      "surface of Lake Nicaragua is 110 feet above the level of the sea, and to\n",
      "reach or descend from this elevation there will be four locks between\n",
      "each end of the lake and the ocean from which it is separated. The lake\n",
      "is 110 miles long by 35 wide, and is a beautiful sheet of water in a\n",
      "basin 8000 square miles in extent. The plans are for locks 650 feet long\n",
      "and 65 feet wide, which will float any ship now in existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: MOZO IN FULL DRESS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "For convenience of description we will suppose the canal to be in three\n",
      "divisions, eastern, middle, and western. The eastern division begins at\n",
      "Greytown, on the Caribbean Sea, at the mouth of the San Juan River, and\n",
      "extends to the Arroyo de las Cascades, a distance of nineteen and\n",
      "one-half miles. This division contains sixty-three per cent. of the\n",
      "excavation required for the whole canal; it will include the digging of\n",
      "a channel through the low lands of the coast, and then through rising\n",
      "ground and hills, where locks must be made to raise the canal to the\n",
      "level of the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the eastern division a dam across the San Juan River will\n",
      "fill the channel of that stream to a depth sufficient for the passage of\n",
      "sea going vessels, and also create a lake, or basin, where ships may\n",
      "pass each other, and also halt for repairs if any are needed. In some\n",
      "places the river must be dredged to reach the requisite depth, but these\n",
      "points are not numerous or difficult. The river is 1000 feet wide, so\n",
      "that ships will have plenty of room for moving either way, and there\n",
      "will be about eighty-three miles of river navigation from the dam to the\n",
      "lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Lake Nicaragua the distance from the head of the San Juan River to\n",
      "the beginning of the western division is fifty-six and one-half miles,\n",
      "and here there is abundant depth of water except in one place where some\n",
      "rock-blasting and dredging will be needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rio Lajas, on the western shore of the lake, will be the end of the\n",
      "middle, or navigable, portion of the canal, and the beginning of the\n",
      "western division, which extends seventeen and one-quarter miles to the\n",
      "Pacific Ocean. On this division ships coming from the east will descend\n",
      "by four locks, while those from the west will rise by the same means.\n",
      "The last of the locks, the one nearest the Pacific, will have a varying\n",
      "depth to accommodate itself to the rise and fall of the ocean tide,\n",
      "which is about nine feet. The entrance of this lock will be of a funnel\n",
      "shape, and a port will be formed by throwing out jetties on each side of\n",
      "the little bay of Brito, and converting it into a secure harbor.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the eastern end of the canal jetties will be thrown out in the same\n",
      "way to form a harbor at the mouth of the San Juan River close to the old\n",
      "harbor of Greytown, which has been partially filled by the sands brought\n",
      "down by the river, and has a depth of only twenty-one feet at its\n",
      "entrance. The current of the river will be utilized for washing out the\n",
      "entrance of this harbor, just as that of the Mississippi was utilized by\n",
      "Captain Eads for deepening the passes of the great \"Father of Waters\" at\n",
      "its mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank and Fred made careful note of the above, and then asked Doctor\n",
      "Bronson how much it was expected the canal would cost, and how the\n",
      "profits had been calculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FORT SAN CARLOS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The estimates of the engineers,\" was the reply, \"place the cost of the\n",
      "whole work at $60,000,000 in round figures; some of them make it ten or\n",
      "twelve millions less, but as estimates nearly always fall short of the\n",
      "actual cost, we will suppose that the figures are $100,000,000. I think\n",
      "it is safe to say the canal can be built for that amount of money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How does that compare with the Suez and the Panama canals?\" Fred asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The cost of the Suez Canal was $100,000,000, and it has been a very\n",
      "profitable enterprise. Double that amount of money has been expended on\n",
      "the Panama Canal, and only one-fourth the work is done; even if it\n",
      "should ever be completed, the revenues cannot be sufficient to pay a\n",
      "good dividend on the cost after deducting the running expenses. The\n",
      "Nicaragua Canal will have a great advantage over the one at Panama, for\n",
      "the reason that the latter is in the region of equatorial calms, while\n",
      "the former is within the sweep of steady winds. Consequently the Panama\n",
      "Canal will be of little use for sailing-ships, and they would all be\n",
      "attracted to the Nicaragua route.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: NATIVE BOATS, LAKE NICARAGUA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the estimate of the amount of business of the Nicaragua Canal,\n",
      "and the revenues from it?\" queried Frank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can best answer that question,\" replied the Doctor, \"by quoting from\n",
      "a writer in _Harper's Magazine_. He says the wheat trade between our\n",
      "Pacific coast and Europe requires a million tons of shipping, and as\n",
      "each ship must pass twice through the canal, this trade alone would be\n",
      "two millions of tons a year. The coasting trade between the Atlantic and\n",
      "Pacific ports of the United States would add another million tons, and\n",
      "the tea trade between Europe and China and Japan, the guano and nitrate\n",
      "trade of South America, the whaling trade of the Pacific, the wool trade\n",
      "between Australia and Europe, would altogether bring the business of the\n",
      "canal up to five or six millions of tons a year. At two dollars a ton,\n",
      "the toll that is charged by the Suez Canal, there would be a revenue of\n",
      "ten or twelve million dollars without considering the growth of the\n",
      "world's commerce from year to year. It is estimated that the running\n",
      "expenses and repairs to the canal would not exceed half a million\n",
      "dollars annually, so that there would be a good profit on the outlay of\n",
      "$100,000,000.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred asked what saving of distances would be effected by the canal.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: CENTRAL AMERICAN HACIENDA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States,\" was the\n",
      "reply, \"the saving would be 8000 or 9000 miles over the Cape Horn route.\n",
      "From New York to ports in Asia and Australasia there would be a saving\n",
      "of 500 to 3000 miles over any route except by Suez, and between Europe\n",
      "and Japan sailing-vessels will save 3000 miles by taking the Nicaragua\n",
      "route. There can be no reasonable doubt that the world's commerce will\n",
      "be greatly benefited by the opening of the proposed canal, and in a few\n",
      "years we may see it operated to its full capacity, of every year passing\n",
      "eleven thousand ships from ocean to ocean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred was ready with another question, but before it was put a friend\n",
      "called to tell them that a steamer for Havana and New York had just\n",
      "arrived at Progreso, and would leave in a few hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicaraguan canals and all other Central American subjects were dropped,\n",
      "and preparations immediately made for departure. Already their farewell\n",
      "calls had been made on friends and acquaintances at Merida, baggage was\n",
      "quickly in readiness, they were at the station in ample time for the\n",
      "train, and before sunset were on the deck of the steamer, which speedily\n",
